**So one book was recommended to me by Shashir, the CEO of Cota. When I started at Slack, he recommended the book Switch**:

How to Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip and Dan Heath. And it's such a good book. And it's about how do you set a path for people to follow. It's the whole elephant and the rider. So setting the path but yet motivating people to go down the path. And I read it. We had an all hands about ... I don't even remember the topic. It was something that we were like all up in arms about that we had to do. And I had just read the book and after the all hands I went up to store it and I'm like, "You did that all wrong. You need to read this book. That is not how to get people motivated." And he read the book and he's like, "You're right." So it just changes how you think in organizations to affect change. So that's on the organizational leadership. And one book I really liked was a Team of Rivals. It's a book about Lincoln and putting together his cabinet during the Civil War. One, I just learned a lot about the Civil War that I didn't really know. And it's about, again, a book about leadership and it is fascinating.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I don't think anyone's recommended either of these. So love them. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
Tamar Yehoshua :
I don't know if you like British murder mysteries.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I don't know either.
Tamar Yehoshua :
It's a niche thing, but there's a guy named Anthony Horowitz and the latest series he did was called Magpie Murders. And it's just an intricate story so I enjoyed it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Very niche but amazing. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?
Tamar Yehoshua :
Well, I'm going to give two. One is tech and one is non-tech. So non-tech I really like dark chocolate.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Actually just like a dark chocolate bar.
Tamar Yehoshua :
A really good dark chocolate that's simple. Like no frills, none of this. Just dark chocolate. And I discovered this chocolate called Bisou chocolate. It's a guy in Oakland who makes it himself. Super niche. He was selling at the farmer's market. And it's just like if you want like a simple play, no nuts, no anything just-
Lenny Rachitsky :
No sea salt.
Tamar Yehoshua :
Great pride in the beans he resources them from.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. It's called Bisou with a B?
Tamar Yehoshua :
Yeah. Bisou as in Kiss in French. And then on the tech side, the honest answer is Glean. I was listening to your podcast with Nikita who said that people over 22 don't use new products except at work. And that stuck with me. The new products I usually use are at work and I use Glean 10, 15 times a day. I use it so much and it changed the way I onboarded. It changed the way I work. Even the simplest questions, you don't bother people, you don't interrupt people on Slack. You're like, "What's the latest status with this deal? What's the last time we talked to them?" I meet somebody at a conference and I can quickly say, "Have we ever talked to this company before?" And I can just get an answer. Or without asking an engineer, "Where's the latest design doc?" It has really transformed how I work. So I know it's cheating in that it's the product I work on, but it's the actual honest answer.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And for folks that haven't heard of Glean, it's one of the most successful B2B AI companies out there. It's like a very large successful business and company that if you haven't checked it out, you should definitely check it out.
Tamar Yehoshua :
As our investors say, it's one of the AI companies that's actually making money.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Very few of those. Awesome. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, repeat yourself, share with friends or family and work or in life?
Tamar Yehoshua :
I have one that my father told me when I was being really indecisive about what college to go to. He was really bored of the conversation and he said, "There are no right decisions. You make a decision right." And it is so true. Because you never know what's going to happen in life. You just have to commit to whatever you're doing and have no regrets about it. You can't be like, "Oh," 10 years later, "what if I had taken that job over there?" It's like you make your success based on how you approach the decisions that you've made.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So if you feel regret about something, this is a good one to pull out of just I will make this the best I can make it, and that's all the best I can do.
Tamar Yehoshua :
You can move forward.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Move forward. I love that. Last question, I know you're a parent. I'm a new parent. I have a 14-month old at this point. Is there a piece of parenting advice that you learned early on that you think might be helpful to me or folks that are new parents or something you've just learned yourself that you think might be helpful?
Tamar Yehoshua :
14 months. I think the best parenting book I read besides the How to Talk So Your Kids Will Listen & How to Listen so Your Kid Will Talk is, I think it's called Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby. We are much happier when we sleep well. We perform better at work when we sleep well. Children need to sleep. So making sure that they sleep well. And sometimes that's like, I did the whole sleep training, cry until you fall asleep and my kids still speak to me. So it was okay. That is the basic things. Make sure that their basic needs are met and then as they grow up, share your life with them. So a piece of advice I was given was analogous to Talk so your Kids Will Listen is when they had come home from school. You can't just say, "How was your day?" Say, "You know what? I did a podcast with this person and it was super interesting because they talked about this or that." Or, "I'm massively screwed up and I should have asked them this or that." And they'll be like, "Oh my God, I was at school today and this is what happened." If you share your life with them, they will share their life with you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Such good advice. I really appreciate it. Tamar, thank you so much for being here. You're awesome. We got through so much great stuff. Everything I was hoping we get through. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to read up on more stuff that you share and just follow you online and how can listeners be useful to you?
Tamar Yehoshua :
Find me on LinkedIn and I have a subject called Practical Intelligence where I've been interviewing practitioners who are working with AI. It was my way of learning. I started when I was a VC. Trying to continue doing it. And how can I be helpful if you are a customer of Glean, I'd love to know what you think, what works and what does more.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What's the best way to share that with you? Is it like messaging on LinkedIn, subscribe to Substack?
Tamar Yehoshua :
Message on LinkedIn, or comment on your-
Lenny Rachitsky :

**On [inaudible 01**:

16:50]. Yeah.
Tamar Yehoshua :
Yeah. Those would probably be the two ways.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Tamar, thank you so much for being here.
Tamar Yehoshua :
Thank you for having me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
