**We didn't change. Back in 2010, we were simply not good enough, we were still in the product market fit iterations and iterations and iterations, and we were not good enough. And we kept on building and we kept on iterating and iterating and iterating. But we almost ran out of cash. And then we had this lucky day that Microsoft decided to invest, and so did Qualcomm. The funny part is that I had this dialogue with Qualcomm Ventures and they told me that they're not sure why is that important for them. And I read someplace that they did not invest at Twitter at $55 million. And this is exactly what I told them, "May I remind you that you did not invest in Twitter at $55 million valuation. This is where Waze is today." And obviously different story, but that was the fear of missing out, the FOMO was [inaudible 01**:

14:58]
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, I was going to say, good FOMO.
Uri Levine :
But the result was that we had enough cash to keep on trying and keep on iterating and iterating and iterating. And eventually we ended up to be very successful. So that was not about pivoting or changing directions or doing anything dramatic. We basically say, okay, we will need to reduce costs dramatically. We decided that we are not ... By the way, what we did is we reduced the salary of the management only. And to a certain extent I would say people didn't even know. We decided in the management meeting that this is what we're going to do. And if push come to shovel, then we will do the next step and the next step and the next step. But we were eventually able to raise capital. So in that sense, the nearly die was a matter of state of mind, but we did not run out of cash, we raised capital just before that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The story is actually really illustrative of a point I was thinking as you were talking, which is that product market fit crisis often also leads to a cash crisis from investors not wanting to invest.
Uri Levine :
In many cases, yes, in many cases.
Lenny Rachitsky :
You get a double whammy.
Uri Levine :
But to a certain extent I would say no. Product market fit basically means that you go back to square one. The other alternative that you have, and by the way it's also valid, is if you are unable to convince your existing investors to reinvest in the company in order to build the new part of the journey, the new journey, then you know what? Shut down the company and restart a new company that is doing exactly that. And that's a bigger threat for investors because they are not part of the new journey. Now, they might want to say, "Oh, the company owns the IP." The know-how is the people, owned by the people, not the company.
Lenny Rachitsky :
How do you avoid the crisis? A lot this advice is here, you have a crisis, here's how to deal with it. Any advice for how to avoid falling into a crisis as a founder?
Uri Levine :
Number one answer is no. Don't worry, you will face crisis. And if you worry, you're still going to face crisis. Number two is that, look, it's way easier to deal with a crisis if you have plenty of cash in the bank. So if you can raise capital and maintain higher level of cash in the bank, it will help you to go through the next crisis, but it's not going to avoid it. So always be funded is a good advice. But in general, look, you do not prepare for the next crisis because you don't know what kind of crisis it's going to be next. And you can assume that there will be the next crisis. Trust me, there will be the next crisis. And then the most important part is that you analyze that fast and then you act fast. But you cannot prepare for it because you don't know where it's going to come from. And this is really, really important. The best preparation is that if you have plenty of cash. In general I would say if you have plenty of cash, then this is going to help you for many things.
Lenny Rachitsky :
When you say plenty of cash, do you have any advice, kind of common advice of have 18 months of runway, is there anything there you'd recommend for founders?
Uri Levine :
And this is really depending on the CEOs and their risk attitude. Some of my CEOs prefer to have two to three years of run rate. They basically say, "This is my comfort zone. I know that I can restart if I need to. I know that I can suffer major crisis. I know that I can go into new direction if I want to. I know that I can expand and try something completely different if I want to." And this is not necessarily as a result of a crisis. So maybe you basically say here is an opportunity and I have the cash to do that.
:
My general rule will be around 18 month. Are you okay with 12 month? Yeah, if you risk taker, bigger risk taker then you can survive with 12 month. But the challenge is that, look, if you have shorter period of time, then you don't have enough time to execute, you need to focus on fundraising all the time. And you want to focus on creating value and not just bringing cash into the company.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. Obviously the downside of raising more runway is you're giving away more of your company, but it's always this trade off, how much to sell, how money to get. Being a founder, what a tough gig. And I'm going to come back to this quote you had that I shared at the beginning of the podcast, which is building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next.
Uri Levine :
Yeah. It goes back into how ... the other three dimensions of a startup, it's a roller coaster journey with ups and downs and ups and downs, and it's a journey of failures because we are trying to build something new that no one did before so we tried multiple things. For that, Albert Einstein used to say that if you haven't failed that because you haven't tried new things before. And it's a long journey, it's a very long journey. In particular, the longest part is until you figure out product market fit. And now I add the fourth dimension of that, that this is a journey from one crisis to the next one.
Lenny Rachitsky :
How many companies have you started, 10 last time I saw?
Uri Levine :
Yeah, about, a little bit more than that, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
A little bit more than that.
Uri Levine :
Not all of them are going to be successful, but most of them are.
Lenny Rachitsky :
In some form. And you just keep doing it. You're a glutton for crisis is what I'm hearing here.
Uri Levine :
I'm not here for the crisis, I'm there for the value creation.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Uri, is there anything else that you wanted to share that you think might be helpful to get into before we wrap up?
Uri Levine :
I really like this podcast, I really like it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Me too.
Uri Levine :
And hopefully, in my mind, this is my mindset of a teacher, my destiny is about value creation, and if this podcast or this book, this one, can help people to become more successful, then I fulfill my destiny.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Uri, I'm so delighted to be helping you fulfill your destiny. Two final questions. Where can folks find the book? When is it for sale? And then just how can listeners be useful to you?
Uri Levine :
The book is going to be published in about a month from now. And it is already available for pre-orders on Amazon, but later on it will be on bookstores throughout the US and Canada and so forth.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What's the date it'll be published because we're recording this ... Maybe it's coming out around the time we publish this. So what's the date?
Uri Levine :
I think it's February 15th.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, great. I think this is coming out right around there, so perfect timing.
Uri Levine :
So perfect timing. And you can follow me on LinkedIn or you can go to my website, urilevine.com. And I want you to read the book. End of the day, you asked me at the beginning what do I want to accomplish? Do I want people to buy the book or read the book? And I told you, "Look, everything that I'm trying to do in my life is about doing good and doing well." So buying the book is the doing well part of it and reading the book is the doing good part of it. And I want you to read the book.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's so good. Uri, thank you so much for being here.
Uri Levine :
Thank you, appreciate it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bye everyone.
