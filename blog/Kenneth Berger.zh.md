## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### Well, it's funny. I used to be a big wine aficionado, and I think as with many of us, I am discovering I feel better with less alcohol in my life. And so one of the things I've been picking up is oolong tea. I've got a little cup of Taiwanese [foreign language 01

09:51] in front of me, and I feel like it's all the nerdery that I put into wine of regions, and varietals, and history and processing, but it's actually good for me. It's like full of antioxidants and makes me more focused and I can drink it during the day. I've been totally going down a nerdy tea rabbit hole, and I recommend it. Taiwanese mountain teas especially.

I got to give me some of that. I always have tea here when I'm doing these podcasts. I'm a less sophisticated tea...

**Well, it's funny. I used to be a big wine aficionado, and I think as with many of us, I am discovering I feel better with less alcohol in my life. And so one of the things I've been picking up is oolong tea. I've got a little cup of Taiwanese [foreign language 01**:

09:51] in front of me, and I feel like it's all the nerdery that I put into wine of regions, and varietals, and history and processing, but it's actually good for me. It's like full of antioxidants and makes me more focused and I can drink it during the day. I've been totally going down a nerdy tea rabbit hole, and I recommend it. Taiwanese mountain teas especially.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I got to give me some of that. I always have tea here when I'm doing these podcasts. I'm a less sophisticated tea drinker. I just go with Earl Grey, but a really nice Earl Grey, and so I'm going to have to buy some of this. Do you have a place in a brand you recommend most?
Kenneth Berger :
There's lots of great stores online. You can check out teafromtaiwan.com. That's a good one.
Lenny Rachitsky :
They're going to get a bunch of traffic. They're like, "What the hell just happened?" Teafromtaiwan.com amazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful, share with friends or family and work around life?
Kenneth Berger :
I mean, I'm pretty sure you can guess, Lenny.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I wonder what it might be. I wonder what it might be.
Kenneth Berger :
So this is actually part of why I started writing this book, is because my friends were probably annoyed with me telling them, "Have you asked for what you wanted? Ask for what you want." Because yeah, it's best advice I have is to ask for what you want.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It all just comes back to that final question. We've been talking a lot about asking for what you want. Kenneth Berger, what do you want?
Kenneth Berger :
Ooh. All right. Well, I think for me, Lenny, you are already an industry luminary with thousands of followers. I am interested in sharing more of these ideas. So if y'all would come follow me on LinkedIn and subscribe to my newsletter, I'm going to be exploring these ideas and sharing more of this stuff because I just am so passionate about it. I'd love if you'd come and join me in that journey, bring questions and ideas, and I'd love to talk about this stuff because I just find it endlessly interesting.
Lenny Rachitsky :
But you're working on a book along these lines at some point that will come out, right?
Kenneth Berger :
That's right, that's right. I am working on it in book form, but part of what I've been doing is I realize I want to work on it in community. Speaking of asking for what you want, I mean, for me, it's not just about my vision and my framing, but I'm a coach. I'm not just about big ideas. I'm about making a difference for my clients. And so I realize, if I really want to make a difference with people, I need... It's like a product, I need to get out in the world and test out these ideas and see what lands with people and what's effective for them and what works, and hear the stories and really get into it. So that's kind of why I've been putting myself more out there.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. So along those lines, two last questions. Where can folks actually find you online and follow the stuff that you're writing and how can listeners be useful to you?
