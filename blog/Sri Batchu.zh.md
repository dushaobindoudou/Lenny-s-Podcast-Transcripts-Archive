## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### I don't think you phrased it that way, but that's [inaudible 00

45:18] for a given user, which is what does it take for somebody to become an engaged and active user or customer of a platform? And at Facebook, it was 10 friends the first seven days. At Instacart, it was three orders in the first month. And at Ramp, for our activation, I mean it's very specific to Ramp, but we've got four events that the customer needs to do in the first 30 days. And if they do that, they have a high likelihood of being activated and successful. So our activation team focuses...

### So there's another approach that I've actually used successfully is much more kind of data driven and external and not as network based, which is you can often look up data. [inaudible 01

02:14] is a lot of it is somewhat public, right? So you can look up information on which companies might be doing well. So for example, I'll just pick like if you're looking for great email marketing folks like CRM marketing lead or something like that, you can actually look up on similar web, what percentage of traffic shows up via email to companies websites. So you've got your target list of companies that are one or two stage beyond you that you respect as general companies. And you can go a...

### So I think it's not about necessarily hiring [inaudible 01

05:44] operators, obviously you're looking for that, but it's also about investing in people that are doing really well and accelerating their growth and rewards based on impact once they're there and as well as managing out people directly that didn't work out. And I typically think it's almost never when I've had to part ways with people is because someone's a bad actor. It's almost always that it just wasn't the right fit for whatever reason, for their skillset, for their life goals or whatev...

### I don't know how many people will use this. I'm still surprised when new folks come to me and it's like I need to write, by the way, a document of how do you work with me? Because I know it's a lot of people have been talking about, I think [inaudible 01

06:51] Johnson's talked about it too, but I say that my love languages are spreadsheets and frameworks. And one very simple one that I've always liked that sometimes people surprised to hear, but it's most consultants know is what we call MECE, mutually exclusive, collectively exhausted set of things. So whenever you're trying to attack a problem and trying to brainstorm solutions or what have you, I really like to remind the teams to think about MECE because when you think about that and evalua...

**I don't think you phrased it that way, but that's [inaudible 00**:

45:18] for a given user, which is what does it take for somebody to become an engaged and active user or customer of a platform? And at Facebook, it was 10 friends the first seven days. At Instacart, it was three orders in the first month. And at Ramp, for our activation, I mean it's very specific to Ramp, but we've got four events that the customer needs to do in the first 30 days. And if they do that, they have a high likelihood of being activated and successful. So our activation team focuses on that.
Lenny :
The framework you just described reminds me Gibson Biddle has this really simple framework of gem where you can basically prioritize one of three things, growth, engagement, or monetization. And his advice is always just all of them are great, just make sure you're all aligned on which one matters most at the time.
Sri Batchu :
Yeah. And it is very similar to, we used to have this at Opendoor, and I think DoorDash also uses a similar framework, which is speed, quality, and cost. All three are important, but it's very hard to optimize all three at the same time. So you need to have a particular prioritization. And I think growth teams can also use that as, okay, I think the way I about the growth team's journey is step one is build a system that can move fast and then work on improving the quality and then work on optimization of cost after. So you pick which phase you're on because you can't do all three at the same time, whether it's growth, engagement, monetization, or just the other way of framing on it.
Lenny :
Speaking of metrics, I have this note here that you're a big fan of payback period for measuring investment ROI versus CAC. Can you talk about why that is?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah. CAC obviously gets thrown around a lot and a lot of people are like, "Okay, you have to be reducing your CAC, CAC, CAC, CAC." There's a fundamental flaw to it which obviously is that you're focusing on cost and not the value derived. And so when you focus on CAC and reducing CAC, what tends to happen is you actually might be doing something very damaging where you're succeeding in reducing CAC, but you're actually bringing in customers that are less valuable because those are the ones that you're able to attract with a lower CAC. And so reframing it away from CAC towards LTV is helpful and that's better. So thinking about for better customers that are bigger, we want to spend more. So you might think, okay, well, LTV to CAC might be a better way of looking at that. I think the challenge with LTV to CAC especially for a lot of, even Ramp, it's only four years old, is it's really hard to predict LTV.
Sri Batchu :
It's like a DCF, it's extremely assumption laden and it's hard to know what the final value will be. And especially if you think your churn is low and your LTV is very high, you might end up spending a lot of money because you're like, "Oh, my LTV to CAC is great." And then a year or two into the business, you realize actually your churn is higher than you thought. Your initial customers aren't representative of your long-term retention and all of a sudden you've destroyed a lot of value by looking at LTV to CAC, which is why I'm a big, big fan of payback period and actually being really thoughtful about that using contribution margin, not revenue or gross margin, like how long of contribution margin from this customer does it take to payback their cost? And setting this obviously is typically a mandate from the executive and board level on what is the payback period that we're comfortable with, and then just orienting everybody towards driving that blended payback period down as much as possible.
Lenny :
For folks that aren't familiar with the concept of payback period or contribution margin, could you just briefly describe what those mean for listeners?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, so contribution margin is basically the profit that you make on a given customer after you take into account all of the variable costs. So including the cost of production as well as any other variable costs to serve that customer. So that might include support and other things that scale with your revenue. And then payback period is literally just how many months of that profit would it take to pay for? Let's say it costs you $5,000 to acquire this customer and your estimated profit per month on the customer is 500. That is a 10-month payback period. So as I say that, I'm sure you've heard, you still have to make assumptions for payback period, but at least they're more based in recency and you can evaluate them more quickly.
Lenny :
Awesome. Thank you for doing that. Just a couple more questions around growth specifically. So there's a lot of ways to grow through the history of a company. You can invest in SEO, you can invest in paid and sales and referrals and influencer marketing, brand marketing, billboards, all these things. Do you have an opinion on how to sequence these sorts of bets for a company, especially in B2B?
Sri Batchu :
Of course, a lot depends on who your customers are, what your unique value propositions are and how competitive the space that you're in. But I do think there's actually a general path that most B2B companies take and should take frankly, which is my view is you start off with founder-led sales, like the early team needs to know how to actually sell, then you hire your first couple of salespeople, then you start some very low cost targeted marketing efforts. So whether it's like content, community, small scale events, and then PR. After all of that is when you start paid and brand efforts. And then SEO probably start around the same time that you start paid marketing efforts.
Sri Batchu :
The reason for the progression the way I've described it is the channels get more expensive as you go farther along and they get more effective as you understand more about your customers and they're more scalable as well as you go farther along the list that I've described. And so that's the intention behind sequencing in that way. SEO is a bit unique. The reason I recommend it later rather than earlier, even though it's not necessarily that expensive, is just take some time to build. And without domain authority or backlinking or any media presence, you can end up just flailing with SEO, creating content and not getting any actual traction for a long time. So there's usually a good inflection point for your company to double down on SEO efforts. And it's somewhat a little bit later than some of the other times.
Lenny :
This touches on a great line that you have around experimentation where you talk about how you don't want to just fail fast with an experiment. You want to fail conclusively, if that's the word. Is that right? And then can you talk about that?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, I talk a lot about that with my teams both here and other places, which is we celebrate failure. Growth experiments in my history are typically 30%-ish success rate. So the vast majority of things that you try don't work. And so you want to create a culture where people aren't afraid to take risks and aren't afraid to fail. And for me, failure is not that you didn't drive revenue, failure is not learning. So it's really important that you learn when you fail. And so we celebrate failure as long as you're learning and you can only learn if you've designed the right test and you failed conclusively because otherwise, I think many of us have been in situations where there's intuition that something might work and it doesn't work, and then you end up doing it over and over for years because every time a new executive or somebody else has the same idea, you try it again and it's because you haven't been able to design the test to fail conclusively, and it's hard to do.
Sri Batchu :
But at the end of the day, there's only two ways to make an experiment successful. Either you have a very large M or have a very significant treatment, which is what you're doing in the experiment itself. And in B2B, you don't usually have the luxury of large M, which you do in consumer. Facebook can get stats taken in two hours. A B2B company could take two years to get the same number of touch points. And so to counteract that, I recommend people just trying to maximize the treatment effect, which is if you have a hypothesis that you're testing, just throw all of the possible tactics and resources that you think would move that needle because you can always cost rationalize later if it works.
Sri Batchu :
And so just maximize the treatment effect. And if with all of that it didn't work, then you can say, "Hey, we're not going to try this again because we literally did try everything that we could to test this hypothesis." And if it doesn't work in the best version and it's expensive as it is, this is not worth spending more time on. But if it does work, great, then you do another version of the test with half the tactics or whichever tactics you think work better or worse and you optimize over time.
Lenny :
Is there an example you could share when you did that?
Sri Batchu :
I mean, account based marketing is something that is very common in enterprise software where you've selected certain customers that you think are high priority and you're saying, "I want to touch them in as many nuanced ways possible to see if that drives conversion." And this is something I've seen tried many times where people do it, but they do it halfway where they're like, "Okay, tried these three things. Conversion of the control group wasn't higher. And so we think this is not going to work."
Sri Batchu :
And then a new go-to market executive comes and they have to do it again. They have to do it again. They have to do it again. It's a very common one wherever this happens. And so when we did it at Ramp, we did exactly what I just described, which is let's really be thoughtful about the experiment design, both in terms of maximizing the number of people as well as maximizing the number of ways and types of ways that we're effectively touching these target customers to show the value one way or the other.
Lenny :
So what it sounds like is the hypothesis isn't like this email will have a big impact on conversion. It's like this strategy of coming after customers is what we're testing.
Sri Batchu :
That's the example there. And I think for example, this kind of framework is more important for cross-functional, larger scale, bigger tests rather than an email modification. But we could even use it on a micro example, like an email modification where you are like, okay, I think this particular email is underperforming because it's not talking to this part of the customer's pain point or journey or what have you. And the simplest test would be, okay, let me make some tweaks to the text and edit that, and that could be the end of that test.
Sri Batchu :
And if that doesn't work, you're like, "Oh, maybe those weren't the right text edits. Let me do a different text edits or whatever." And that's fine, that's low cost. It's not the end of the world for you to be wrong there. But an alternative that you could do is like, oh, what are all of the things that I could change about this email in the same test? Is it the trigger of the email? Is it the text content of the email? Is it additional personalization? Is it the design of the email? Trying to think of what are all of the various levers that you think could be wrong and put them all together to test your hypothesis of this touchpoint is wrong and how do I improve that.
Lenny :
Well, obviously the downside of that is if it doesn't work, you don't know if it's like, oh, maybe it was this thing could have worked in the subject-
Sri Batchu :
Yeah. So there's always trade-offs on this. But what you're hoping is you've done a complete refresh where you did all the things that you thought were intuitive that should work. And if it doesn't work, then you're like, "Okay, maybe my hypothesis is wrong." But you're right. There's always going to be a challenge if maybe the execution is wrong and I did too many things potentially in that case.
Lenny :
How does that go with the velocity culture? Is it just do those things real fast even though it's not like micro optimize, it's like go bigger but do them fast?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah. Yeah. So that's why I think it's important to frame where this matters. And so I think I'm less worried about failing conclusively for things that you can fail really, really fast and just redo, right? Things like website conversion, email, et cetera. I'm more worried about that for things that take a while to plan and cost money, et cetera.
Lenny :
Got it. Okay. Great. Maybe one last question around growth specifically. What are some of your favorite tools for the growth team, either internally, whatever you can share, or externally that just allow you to operate efficiently and effectively?
Sri Batchu :
A couple of things that we've used, I mean, one simple thing is for sprint planning, actually, we use Airtable because the planning process and the scoring is so much more analytical and the translation layer. So we've got a template on how we do our sprint planning and how we translate the various impact metrics into the common currency, which I enjoy, but I don't see it has to be Airtable. It's just some form of organization that works well for that. In terms of a very tactical growth tool that we've enjoyed recently is we used this company called Mutiny, which is also around customer, which is a tool for website copy, personalization. So they hook up with our third party data sources that we pay for, and based on what we know about the customer as they're landing on our page, we can personalize, copy, and design based on that. And that's had material impact and allowed us to scale website experimentation.
Lenny :
Amazing. And then are there internal tools you've built to help with experimentation or I don't know, sharing data, dashboard? I don't know, is there anything else that's just like, wow, this really helps us move fast?
Sri Batchu :
Eric, our CEO, has publicly talked about this. I think we as a company are very thoughtful about what we build in-house versus what we buy externally. I think a lot of engineering teams are often excited about building things in-house where there's off the shelf products that could basically work externally. And Ramp has historically been good at not falling into that trap. And we use third party tools for a lot of our growth and experimentation for things that are not proprietary, strategic, et cetera, obviously. Some of the automation stuff that we've talked about, we've built all of that in-house in terms of prospecting, lead scoring, and how we talk to our customers. But for the most part, we use external tools. Instacart and Opendoor were not like that. We built our own internal experiment tracking systems, A/B testing frameworks and all of that in-house.
Lenny :
That's what I would've guessed about Ramp that it's with speed, you got to not build stuff you don't have to build. So that makes a lot of sense. Okay. Maybe one last topic to talk about. I want to talk about hiring. You have some really interesting approaches to how to think about hiring. One is I think you have a really interesting strategy for how to find the best companies and also the best people at each of those companies to go after if you're hiring for specific role. Can you talk about how you think about that?
Sri Batchu :
Gokul on Twitter has talked about some of those, which is there's two ways to go about hiring great people. One way is basically a very thoughtful and tactical network search where let's say you're hiring for a head of SEO, you go ask your network of who is the best SEO person you know, get introduction to each of those folks, and then ask them who the best person that they know is. And you have a mapping of where are the best SEO teams and why. If you can't get one of those people, 20, 30 people on your target list, you go down the list of, okay, what is the next best person? And you typically want to limit it to companies that are one to two stages of growth after you. So you want somebody that has seen your stage of growth and beyond at a company that has a reputation for craft and the field that you're looking for. So that's a very classic way of doing that, and I think that works really well for people and companies that are really well-connected.
Sri Batchu :

**So there's another approach that I've actually used successfully is much more kind of data driven and external and not as network based, which is you can often look up data. [inaudible 01**:

02:14] is a lot of it is somewhat public, right? So you can look up information on which companies might be doing well. So for example, I'll just pick like if you're looking for great email marketing folks like CRM marketing lead or something like that, you can actually look up on similar web, what percentage of traffic shows up via email to companies websites. So you've got your target list of companies that are one or two stage beyond you that you respect as general companies. And you can go and see, okay, which ones of these are actually really effective at driving web traffic or app traffic or app downloads via their email. And then go try to source from those teams and companies. And I think people under-utilize that even though it's very intuitive, it's just not something that occurs to people to do.
Lenny :
I love that. I've not heard that tip right there. The first piece, Google definitely recommends this, and I think the core part of that is the core theme here is find the companies that are the best at the thing you're trying to hire for, and then figure out who at the company is the best once you start talking to people. I love it. Another strong opinion that I think you have is around paying people and how much to pay the best. Can you talk about that?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, I think there's a lot of conversation around compensation is very much focused on equality and narrowing the gap and bands for compensation. And I think personally, I know it's a bit of a spicy take maybe, but I think it's the exact opposite direction of the conversation that companies should be having about compensation, which is I strongly, strongly believe that small teams of successful people can drive a lot more impact than larger teams of mediocre people.
Sri Batchu :
And so I strongly believe you have to design a system where you're able to reward 10X operators with 10X the comp. You certainly see that at the executive level. So if you look at the same executive at different companies at similar stages, the comp can be widely different based for a variety of reasons. But one of them is the perception of performance and potential by the management team. And I think people need to be thinking about how to do that across more levels, which is if you can do that, and if you do that well, I think you're able to differentially hire and retain the best talent. And that'll be a great competitive advantage for companies that can do that well.
Lenny :
And do you think about this within a team pay the best people the most, or is it more only hire these 10X people and then pay everyone the most?
Sri Batchu :
People think of the talent density of your company as dependent on hiring. And that's obviously true. It's an important part of the ecosystem and the first part, but it's equally dependent on retention and performance management. A lot of companies can be good at hiring, but hiring has pretty high rate of false positive. Interview is the worst, best way to hire somebody. And then there's lots of ways you can make the interviewing process better, make it more interactive, make it more effective, but at the end of the day, you still don't know about someone until you really work closely with the new team, with the new mandate at your company.
Sri Batchu :

**So I think it's not about necessarily hiring [inaudible 01**:

05:44] operators, obviously you're looking for that, but it's also about investing in people that are doing really well and accelerating their growth and rewards based on impact once they're there and as well as managing out people directly that didn't work out. And I typically think it's almost never when I've had to part ways with people is because someone's a bad actor. It's almost always that it just wasn't the right fit for whatever reason, for their skillset, for their life goals or whatever it may be. And it just wasn't a fit for that role. And I think a lot of companies are hesitant to make those changes, and I think that's how they bring their talent bar down, frankly.
Lenny :
Absolutely agree. Sri, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Sri Batchu :

**I don't know how many people will use this. I'm still surprised when new folks come to me and it's like I need to write, by the way, a document of how do you work with me? Because I know it's a lot of people have been talking about, I think [inaudible 01**:

06:51] Johnson's talked about it too, but I say that my love languages are spreadsheets and frameworks. And one very simple one that I've always liked that sometimes people surprised to hear, but it's most consultants know is what we call MECE, mutually exclusive, collectively exhausted set of things. So whenever you're trying to attack a problem and trying to brainstorm solutions or what have you, I really like to remind the teams to think about MECE because when you think about that and evaluate your set of solutions with that framework in mind, I think you tend to find that you've catch more potential solutions and also you'll feel comfortable that you've been comprehensive in your solution development. So anyway, just a little thing for people that are earlier in their careers to not forget.
Lenny :
So let's make it a little bigger than a little thing. So MECE, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive. Is there an example of what that may look like and or visualize for people to think about what this means in practice?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah. I mean, I'll give it really dumb example, but that will make the point hopefully. It's like, okay, our profitability or our revenue growth has slowed down is the problem that you're trying to solve. And so okay, you start with, okay, what does this mean? You've got revenue per user has gone down, or customer has gone down, or number of customers have slowed down. Okay, that's step one of the MECE framework. Then it's like, okay, where does the revenue come from? What are all the various products that revenue could be coming from? Has it changed on any one of them? And then customers, why have customers gone down? Is it new customer acquisition? Is it activation of customers that have signed up? Is it retention? And just breaking that problem. So at each layer you've collectively exhausted all of the possible ways that this problem could have arrived. And just having that framework whenever you approach every problem will prevent you from missing something important. And also just more generally give you an others' confidence that you're being comprehensive in your solution development.
Lenny :
Got it. So one way to think about this in this specific case is just make a formula of all of the variables that play into the question you're trying to answer.
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, exactly.
Lenny :
Awesome. Well, Sri, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, let's do it.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Sri Batchu :
I tend to find most business books can be decks, but one that I really like actually is Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss. It's a negotiation book, find it super helpful for negotiation, but also for a lot of business decision making generally, to be honest, and life. And then I'm a big fan of sci-fi short stories, so anything by Ted Chiang or Ken Liu, I highly recommend.
Lenny :
I love those both. On the first one I'm actually in the process of listening to it on audio and every time I'm in a place where I can negotiate something, I never remember anything that I've learned. Is there one thing that you've taken away from that book that stuck with you of like I use this?
Sri Batchu :
I think that the core of the book really is about listening behind the problem of negotiation and what is the person really asking for. So his example of if you're always trying to split things evenly, you'll end up with one brown shoe, one black shoe, where neither of you are happy. And so rather than thinking about BATNA and ZOPA and all the other business school frameworks on negotiation, I think focus on deep down what does this other person want and how can I change the conversation about that rather than the thing that we're arguing over.
Lenny :
Awesome. Great. Next question. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?
Sri Batchu :
I mean, obviously it won the Oscar, but I really enjoyed Everything Everywhere All at Once. I thought it was such a wonderful story and really I think it's one of those... It's funny. The movie can also be, I think, everything because there are just so many different reads that you can get about that. It's about family, it's about immigration, it's about love. There's a lot of really interesting themes explored via one movie.
Lenny :
What's a favorite interview question you like to ask?
Sri Batchu :
I was going to say, oh, I like to ask other people.
Lenny :
You like to ask. What did you think I was going to ask?
Sri Batchu :
Oh, I thought what was my favorite interview question that you've asked or others have asked?
Lenny :
Oh, I got to clarify this. Both are acceptable answers.
Sri Batchu :
I was going to cheat on that one and say the one that you asked me right before, because I'm a big fan of actually movies and TV shows and people rarely ask about that interviews like this, but favorite interview that I'd like to ask candidates actually is what's something that you're really bad at but you still do and why?
Lenny :
What do you look for in their answer when you ask them?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, a lot of people actually struggle with that question and can't answer anything that they do that they're bad at, which is a little bit of a yellow flag, which means that they're only used to doing things that they're successful at and they haven't cultivated interests that are not correlated to their own success at doing something. And they haven't taken the time to do that. And folks like that are going to run at the first sign of trouble and be like, "Oh, I'm not successful at this, so I'm going to move on." And what I really want to see is people that show examples of things that they're not successful at that they do for other motivations and goals and interests. And so if you can tell me a compelling story like that, it's usually a winning answer so to speak.
Lenny :
What is a favorite product or two that you've recently discovered that you love?
Sri Batchu :
Carrie mentioned Eight Sleep once in this call. I love my Eight Sleep. I'm a big fan and they're Ramp customers as well. And so that's been a great pandemic purchase. So I guess maybe not as recent. And then maybe another one is Fellow coffee, their kettles I think just designed so beautifully. I don't drink coffee, I drink tea, but I use my Fellow kettle for tea, and I think it's just a delightful product to use.
Lenny :
I got a Fellow kettle from my tea also, and I found that the flow of the water was too slow and it's just standing here pouring this pour over.
Sri Batchu :
Yeah. Yeah. So they do have a non-pour over kettle, which is what I have, which makes it easier.
Lenny :
Okay. My mistake. Next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that you found to have a big impact on your ability to execute?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if this is minor or not, but one of the things that on the growth side, we used to have separate sprint planning for the product team, for the marketing teams, and each team had their own planning cycles. And one of the things that we did is we brought them all together into one. So the lifecycle marketers joined the product activation team sprint cycles, and so their projects and work are very tightly aligned and work in the same pace and system as the rest of the product team. And that's had tremendous impact in our ability to work together.
Lenny :
Final question, Ramp is all about helping people save money. I'm curious if you have any tips on just saving money.
Sri Batchu :
I mean, it seems obvious, and I think I feel like negotiation's already been the theme of this lightning round, but everything is negotiable when it comes to contracts. People think contracts are standardized for software and usually not. People are trying to sell you something they're trying to grow too. They have their quotas to meet, they have their goals to hit. So I mean, Ramp obviously has a service for this if you wanted to scale these Ramps, but you can do this on your own. Always try to negotiate, be mindful of quarter ends for salespeople. And so if you can push something out till near the end of the quarter, you can ask for, "Hey, I'll sign it by the end of the month if you give me a 10% discount," will often work. So there's tips like that you can do, but remember that you can always negotiate.
Sri Batchu :
And then the second one is, I would say is just hire slower. I'm a big believer in, and Geoff talks about this too in your other interview, hiring based on slope rather than intercept, I think will work well for you and only hiring when people and teams are really stretched. I think this will serve you well both on cost and on impact. There'll be plenty of scope for the people that you hire, and as I said, I'm a big believer in small teams accomplishing more like Ramp being like a fraction of the size of some of our competitors with similar orders of revenue.
Lenny :
Sure. We've covered velocity, growth, hiring. So many topics, everything I was hoping we touch on. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, I'm a big fan of the fun place of the cesspool of Twitter, so I have a public Twitter account that you can DM me. My DMs are open, it's just my name's sri_batchu. And in terms of listeners can be useful, honestly, I think I really enjoy meeting like-minded folks, and as I may have mentioned in other places, Ramp is growing incredibly well and we're constantly looking to hire and we're still hiring. So if you know best in class growth in marketing folks that they can recommend that we hire at Ramp, I'd love to hear.
Lenny :
And I think the URL is ramp.com/careers. I just pulled it up.
Sri Batchu :
Yep, that's it. Thank you.
Lenny :
All right, Sri, well thank you again so much for being here and for sharing so much.
Sri Batchu :
Yeah, of course. Thank you.
