**I say Gibson Biddle. I think that he is one, just tremendous amount of product experience that I think is valuable. I respect the fact that he takes the time to share it. He doesn't have to, but he does. And he's also a great communicator and he invests in being ... You can tell he measures [inaudible 01**:

03:02] of his talks and things like this. He's invested over his career to be a great communicator. So I think he's a good role model for me and I think for others out there.
Lenny :
That guy's a force. I'm happy that we've had him on this podcast. I'm hoping that everyone eventually, that people mention in this question we end up having on this podcast. So that's great to check. I also love Gibson. He's got a great newsletter. Askgibbs.substack.com I think. Ian, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. I really appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Ian McAllister :
Yeah, I guess Twitter's a great place. So IanMcAll, I-A-N-M-C-A-L-L, is my handle. And then I've started a newsletter. I'm not that frequent to be honest. I have a lot of good intentions and a bunch of ideas. Ianmcallister.substack.com. And that's something to connect and feel free to subscribe and hit me up on Twitter if you have ideas for posts or questions. And if I can answer in a tweet, I will. If not, I might put it on the queue of things to write about. And yeah, thanks for having me on Lenny. We were talking earlier about writing or doing other things and the value of that is just making connections with people. And so that was what I was one, just to reconnect with you is awesome. And to whatever extent I get a chance to make new connections in the world, that's a good thing.
Lenny :
Amazing. And we originally connected over that piece that you wrote, so it all circles back 10 years later maybe. Thanks, Ian.
Ian McAllister :
All right. Thanks Lenny.
