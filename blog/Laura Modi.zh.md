**100%. I call it intellectual ejaculation, which, if that's not allowed of the podcast, [inaudible 00**:

45:52] totally wiped.
Lenny :
That's allowed. I'll allow it.
Laura Modi :
Thank you.
Lenny :
Okay, so you're talking about momentum. I want to talk about growth. A lot of this podcast is about growth strategy, how companies grow. You're building a D2C company. D2C is really hard. There's been so many attempts. Most fail, most people can't figure out how to do it scalably. So many challenges. What have you learned about growing D2C company? What's worked well for you?
Laura Modi :
This narrative of D2C isn't working, or D2C is over, D2C is dead. It kills me. Because we're being way too reductionist in that message. D2C isn't dead. Just the approach for how people did D2C is a bit dated. We should not be paying for every customer and we should be very careful that people aren't getting hooked on the drug that is paid marketing or performance marketing. And I think that drug, and then obviously as we start to see changes on the way certain performance works, it just becomes more expensive and people are resetting how they do performance marketing. The short of it is D2C is not dead. How you drive people to D2C, how you acquire customers, how you build sustainable businesses, that needs to change.
Lenny :
And what is it that you've done that allows you to do that? I imagine a lot of it is word-of-mouth, which everyone always wants. "How do we do more word-of-mouth?" So what's worked? How do you do that?
Laura Modi :
Well, I mean, the three major pieces of it is that the focus on commerce, content and community.
Lenny :
Commerce, content and community.
Laura Modi :
So commerce, content and community. But most D2C businesses have put commerce at the top of their list. We flipped it. It's now content, community and commerce, and building good content that is really smart SEO, that has the ability to drive people back to your site to be able to build you as a thought leader. That's really hard and it takes a lot of work. As an example, five years ago we started a platform called Milk Drunk, separate to Bobbie. Milk Drunk Blog. And the reason why we started it is because we realize that there was a dearth of education in the world of formula out there.
:
And what people were really looking for was good recommendations, usability charts, how to make formula, how long does formula last? So we wanted to become the content leaders in that, with the hypothesis, and it's holding true five years later, with the hypothesis that if we win on content and as a thought leader, that will drive back to Bobbie. And today I'm going to give you a totally random example. If you do a cursory Google search for something like "How long does formula last?" Milk Drunk is showing up between the CDC and the bum on the first page of Google? That SEO work and that content building and thought leadership and credibility does take a lot of work. And in the meantime, I've had to squat away requests to put another 100,000, another 300,000 every month into paid marketing because the moment that drug starts, it's very easy to keep it going.
Lenny :
I think Airbnb is a great example of that. During COVID, they shut down paid growth and I think they've turned it on, but it's a tiny component, which is really unusual and really rare, where you have paid growth, you're sending tons of money, Facebook, and then you stop. It's so hard to stop because growth slows and no one ever wants to do that. And it's interesting, coming back to using a crisis as an opportunity, Airbnb use that as an opportunity to get off that drug.
Laura Modi :
That's right. Yeah.
Lenny :
If you think about the pie chart of what helps Bobbie grow, how much of it would you say is just like make an awesome product that people talk about with other moms and it spreads like that, versus SEO and content and paid?
Laura Modi :
60% of it is your product and the package around the product, which is your brand. So even if you did nothing to market your brand, your product and brand is 60% of it. And then the last 40% is how do you get the word out there? How do you ensure the word-of-mouth, mom begets mom? That has to happen. That flywheel will only happen if they're able to look at a product that they fully believe in and a brand that speaks to them. And without that, you're going to be a fast-fashion company, which is also my worst nightmare, the fear that people get distracted by the 40% and the 60% actually is just mediocre.
Lenny :
Something I wasn't planning to ask, but I thought it'd be interesting and we can cut this if it's not interesting, is Emily Oster, she's one of the, I think, pioneers of breastfeeding is not as great as people say necessarily. Has that been really important to Bobbie in this industry? What do you think of Emily Oster? I'm a huge fan, so I hope you're also a big fan.
Laura Modi :
We are massive fans of Emily and Emily's a massive fan of Bobbie. She is my idol. She's the one who got me through my first year of pregnancy and then beyond. She has been a really, really important voice. And actually she has kind of set the stage for the power of data to bust myths. I mean, just like you said, she's come out and said, "There is no study, no study at all out there that you can point to that can qualify why breastfeeding is better." And to have an economist, a professor, come out and to be able to underscore that and point to where that is the case and why it is the case. I mean, it's so much better than a company. To be fair, companies are brands coming out trying to say that. So I am acutely aware that, as a business and as a brand, sometimes we need to bring in other credible voices. And my God, Emily is one of those.
Lenny :
I love it. Okay, great. I'm glad. I'm glad you love her. I've been reading all our books. I think I just read that section.
Laura Modi :
You read her books. I love it. You're not a dad yet, you'll like all of them, Family Firm.
Lenny :
Okay, the first two. The first two. Cribsheet. I'll stop there, I think. And I was actually just reading the breastfeeding section and it's funny, one of the only remaining benefits of breastfeeding is less cow farts and creating methane. Unrelated to your child, there's a cow component.
Laura Modi :
We do want to cut down on the farts.
Lenny :
We do. We do. Not what I thought of when I thought of why should I go with formula or not. Maybe just zooming out a little bit and to kind of close, are there any other lessons that you've learned along this journey about building a company, hiring, team building, anything along those lines? Creating urgency, creating momentum?
Laura Modi :
I mean, momentum. Momentum really is it. We did this a good bit at Airbnb too. I think as a founder and as a CEO or for any leader out there, your job is not just to keep people going on momentum. Your job is to make momentum. And sometimes that momentum has to be manufactured. And that has been one of my biggest lessons on just how, as leaders and people starting companies, how do you force yourself? And sometimes when it's early on, you're actually just doing it to yourself, creating manufactured deadlines and launch dates.
:
The amount of times people say to me, "Why are we launching this May 1st?" And I'm like, "Just because we said it. Because if we don't do it now, we may never do it." It was something we were talking about the last day on just how important it is to look at the fuel that keeps you going and how you have to kind of force those milestones to get you there. So yeah, I would say manufacture yourself some momentum.
Lenny :
I so agree with that. One of my favorite things and one of our former colleagues, Vanessa, taught me this, which is just like, "Let's all set an arbitrary deadline right now." And just make it clear, this is just arbitrary, but it's useful.
Laura Modi :
It's so true.
Lenny :
Well, with that, Laura, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
Laura Modi :
Who?
Lenny :
I don't know if I told you this was coming, but it is. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for exciting lightning round?
Laura Modi :
I think I am. Let's do it.
Lenny :
Okay, let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Laura Modi :
One recently, Great by Choice, the author of From Good to Great, amazing.
Lenny :
Jim Collins?
Laura Modi :
Some really, really good frameworks. Yes, that's right. Really good frameworks in there. Metabolical, very specific into the world of health, healthcare. Actually, very specifically the takeaway of Metabolical is we don't have a healthcare crisis in this country, we have a health crisis. And it really makes you think about the source, food and how we live our lives. It's amazing. And then I think you a really good traditional one, going back to just brand and for people who are really just looking for a good foundation, I love Purple Cow.
Lenny :
I love that. I think I have it in my back around here.
Laura Modi :
You do?
Lenny :
There it is, yeah. Tiny little book. It's so cute.
Laura Modi :
That is so good.
Lenny :
Yeah. Also, we could mention Emily Oster's book, Laura, Expecting Better.
Laura Modi :
I mean, we should. Expecting Better is a good classic.
Lenny :
Your list is reminding me of a new book by Peter Attia, that I don't know if you've seen, called Outlive, I think it's called. It's about longevity and how to live longer and all the latest sciences and how to live a longer life. But anyway, that's my answer and I'm asking you questions, so let's move on to the next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Laura Modi :
Bad Sisters. Do you have bad sisters?
Lenny :
No.
Laura Modi :
About a group of Irish sisters getting up to trouble. Highly recommended.
Lenny :
Amazing. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're hiring people?
Laura Modi :
Teach me something. Actually, we just talked about that today. Teach me something. Yeah. I love getting someone to, not related to work, not related to their job, something in your life, something you find interesting, just teach me about it.
Lenny :
What is it that you look for in their answer that gives you a sense that they're someone that you want to hire?
Laura Modi :
Creative, but also just their ability to explain something, and it is a huge indicator. I mean, I'll never forget one guy teaching me how to cook the perfect steak, and now every time I cook a steak, I go back to the way he described it, to someone being able to teach me the foundation of Latin. But if someone's unable to take one thing that they find is core to who they are and what they've done or what they understand and their inability to explain that to you, they may struggle.
Lenny :
I want to learn how to cook a perfect steak. I'm going to have to interview you at some point and ask you about that. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love? And especially if it's a baby product, that'll be bonus.
Laura Modi :
I mean, yeah, I think Frida Baby's amazing, the nose sucker.
Lenny :
Okay, great. The nose sucker.
Laura Modi :
Actually, no. Sorry, the nose sucker. That's terrible. It's the snot sucker.
Lenny :
Okay, great.
Laura Modi :
As a new parent, you really, really need this, Lenny. Your poor little boy is going to get blocked up and you're going to want to get out that sucker and suck on it-
Lenny :
Oh, dear.
Laura Modi :
... and get it out. I can see you quickly looking for the next question. Move away from the snot sucker.
Lenny :
No, this is great.
Laura Modi :
So I'll leave you with that.
Lenny :
Perfect. We'll just call the episode The Snot Sucker. So many options. Okay, next question. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in the way that you build/ship product that was minor but had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute and ship?
Laura Modi :
More recently, async work. Moving away from meeting culture and being able to be in a position where we can work async, whether it's one-hour sprint over Slack, make decisions and go back and forth, 20 people, and then everyone's made a decision by the end of the hour and we're moving forward.
Lenny :
Is there a tool that helps you do that or is it just in Slack? "Here's the question we're trying to answer," and everyone-
Laura Modi :
You know what? Every so often we try and introduce tools and then it's like we've over-processed this entire thing, when what we really just need to do is all just get our head into the moment we're in and brand it and get it done. So even though I think we've introduced some tools, I know we use some video ones as well. I'm a little bit removed sometimes from everyone working through these tools, but I'm in the Slack world the most.
Lenny :
Final question, what is your best advice for a soon-to-be parent, aka, me?
Laura Modi :
Hire a sitter who you love that you want to have on board every Thursday night and keep your date night with Michelle, whatever your date night is, and just don't worry about the price because the date is worth it, but just lock it in and do it.
Lenny :
We actually have a date night currently with another couple who has two kids, and so we could just maintain that. How early do you hire a sitter to do that, in their age?
Laura Modi :
Second week.
Lenny :
Second week. Okay, great. Not first week.
Laura Modi :
Okay. Maybe second month. It totally depends on how you guys are feeling.
Lenny :
No. Okay, that early.
Laura Modi :
That depends on how she's feeling, but I would say sometimes you just need to rip the bandaid and you need to go for it, even if it means the two of you are just going out for a quick meal and you're coming back, keep your date night.
Lenny :
Laura, this was as fun and insightful as I expected. I'm going to go try some Bobbie, I'm going to go by snot suckers. Thank you so much for spending time here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, learn more about Bobbie, potentially, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Laura Modi :
Okay. Well, the first thing I'm going to say, how listeners can be useful. I am hiring a growth product manager right now and we are really focused on optimization. So now I'm moving away from everything I just said and I want a specialist who's really good at growth optimization. And how folks can find us, our website is hibobbie, H-I bobbie, B-O-B-B-I-E.com. And if folks just want to reach out to me, I would highly recommend just sending me an email, Laura@hibobbie.com.
Lenny :
And for the hiring position, how do they go apply for that and learn more about it?
Laura Modi :
Great question. I'm assuming it's on our careers page on the website.
Lenny :
Great. We'll make sure it's there before this all goes out.
Laura Modi :
Amazing.
Lenny :
Laura, this is amazing. Thank you so much for being here.
Laura Modi :
It's such a pleasure, Lenny. This is so fun.
Lenny :
It's my pleasure. And goodbye, everyone.
Laura Modi :
Bye.
