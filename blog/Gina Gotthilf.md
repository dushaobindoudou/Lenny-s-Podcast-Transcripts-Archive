**Look, I think for Duolingo we constantly looked at every copy we wrote and asked, "Could this have been written by other companies? Could this have been any other company or is it Duolingo? What makes this Duolingo?" And it was tough because the more people you hire who come from other backgrounds, they're not used to that style and they might even think it's unprofessional or whatever. You're like, "Nope, this is the Duolingo way." So, it helps figuring out, exactly what does that voice, what does it sound like? What are some words that it tends to use? Why yes, why not? What's too much, what's too little? In terms of specific examples, this is something that I didn't write myself, but I wrote a lot of notifications for Duolingo for the passive-aggressive messages that I'm sure people have received, which started and then became a meme and then Duolingo used as well, but the whole, "This doesn't seem to be working. We'll stop sending them for now," message, which you got after five days of inactivity. In addition to that message, around the same time we decided to send an email to people in New Year's because that's when people make a resolution to do things and we wanted them to make learning a language a resolution for the year. So, we created an email and it had Sad Duo because there was... I don't know if the screen is still there, I haven't used Duolingo in a while, but there was always a screen of Duo really sad when you fail something and that [inaudible 00**:

53:24]-
Lenny :
Duo the owl.
Gina Gotthilf :
Duo is the owl, sorry. The green owl will cry and we A/B tested the size of the puddle and the number of tears that came out of his eyes in terms of effectiveness. So, we used Sad Duo in one of those emails and then someone picked it up on Twitter and the passive-aggressive message and this Sad Duo, they started making their own versions, which was like, "Study now or Duo will eat a poisoned loaf of bread," or, "The next email will be a funeral e-vite," things like that.
:
And so that's an example, I think, to me, which can now be seen very much throughout Duolingo's brand where we could have just said, "Oh no, this is a PR disaster. We need to go back to being this friendly, nice little fluffy thing that everyone loves." Instead being like, "No, we get that people think this is funny and we're just going to run with it," because using the Duo voice, it gives us the permission to do that because we're not square, we're not going to do that thing that you read in the textbook in school. We're kind of going to play along with it.
Lenny :
That's an incredible lesson. It reminds me of this famous Duolingo meme that I'm sure you've seen where someone shared these... They got these two notifications in a row, I just pulled it up here, where first they got this Duolingo push notification, "It looks like you forgot your Spanish lessons again, you know what happens now," and then the next push was from their security system, "Intruder alert, backdoor, proceed with caution," and I imagine Duolingo even leaned into that, I think when this started spreading.
Gina Gotthilf :
100%, and it wasn't an easy decision because of course a lot of people in the company were really concerned about the brand image and, what are people doing and how do we revert this, that kind of thing. So, it was a bet that we made where we're just going to, "No, we're going to lean into it because that's what having this unique voice means. It's about getting it. It's about being part of something bigger. It's about connecting with people outside of just teaching them a word a day," or whatever it is. And with Latitud, I think we do that all the time in our newsletter and it's a lot of self-deprecating humor for Latinos and using expressions that could be almost offensive, but they're not in terms of Latinos only, but also the tech world, making fun of being a tech founder and the things that we do that we think are okay and it's just a lot of that where I think I would call it irreverent.
:
It's a tough line, it's a lot easier to be, I think, a copywriter in a place that doesn't want to do that because the lines are a lot clearer and you don't have to take as many risks, but it's so less fun, which I think makes it so less fun for the user because people are used to getting emails from their banks with corporate lingo that you don't understand, but if they get an email from their bank that's funny, ironic, but also very informative, that's a bank email I'm going to read.
Lenny :
I think that's a really good lesson. Part of this is just taking a risk. I think that's one of the big takeaways here is just take some risks. We had Lulu Cheng on the podcast who is a huge advocate of that. She is a PR comms person that's worked at Substack and Blizzard now, and that was her advice to people-
Gina Gotthilf :
Take risks?
Lenny :
Take risks, do things that are a little controversial because that'll get attention. I definitely want to talk about Latitud, just a couple more questions on Duolingo. One is, today feels like one of the most interesting things about Duolingo is their TikTok presence and it feels like they're doing so well, kind of leaning into exactly what you're talking about, just being really silly and different with the owl especially. I guess the question there is just, what is it that you think allows for that? Is it just this very special social media person they hired that was just incredibly good at this thing and being irreverent as you said, or is there something else that contributes and allows a company to win in social media the way that Duolingo has?
Gina Gotthilf :
Look, I haven't met the person who does a TikTok and they're fantastic. I definitely don't want to demerit their work. It's awesome, I don't think it's easy to do, especially on a consistent basis. So I think, yes, finding someone who gets humor, who gets the platform, who's able to produce content quickly, but also reacts to learnings, all of that is not easy to do. However, I do think that everything we just talked about is at the bottom of that because if Duolingo didn't have this unique voice and leaned into the humor and wanted to be irreverent as a brand and was so focused on connecting with people where they were and ready to take risks that might seem maybe unorthodox, especially in terms of education, then an opportunity to build a TikTok like that wouldn't exist. So it's both, and I think it goes back to the brand DNA, it goes back to the culture of the company and to the attention, as I said, to every single text that was published and whether or not it wasn't the right voice or not.
:
It has to do with having those conversations with the executive team where you talk about who is Duo and what are they like and how do they talk and what do they sound like and is this a Duo thing to say, is this not a Duo thing to say? And committing to this idea that you're going to be remembered, that you're going to do things that sometimes are going to rub people the wrong way, and you're not just going to sit squarely in one place. I think that opens the possibility for a TikTok like the one that Duolingo has today to exist, but again, whoever's running the TikTok, you're amazing.
Lenny :
That's such a good lesson. A lot of people are looking at Duolingo, we need to find that person at our company. And what you're saying is it takes a lot more than that. That person is not going to have a good time if the culture of the company isn't set up to be that... To have that approach to try to just take risks and be irreverent, so that's a really good point. One final question around internationalization, you said that you helped drive internationalization of Duolingo, and I read somewhere that one of the learnings you had there was essentially treat everyone the same almost across countries, which I think people think is the counter. They should often like, "No, we should be super personalized for every country we're in." What did you learn there?
Gina Gotthilf :
I think this is very controversial because not only is it the case that when you're working in regulated industries, maybe in more B2B situations, looking at specific countries is important. Looking at specific countries and elements of these countries are important, especially when you're looking at, I don't know, laws and if you need legal differences and there's a lot of things that make countries different is what I'm trying to get. However, humans are very similar and we think we're very different. I don't think we're that different. I think that maybe we were brought up differently, and so for example, in Brazil we like to dance. In Mexico, we like to dance salsa, in some places it's okay to hug and other places it's not okay to hug. Yes, there are cultural differences and it's important to love everyone and to adapt, et cetera, but a lot of these differences when it comes to core human behavior are that final 5% of understanding people.
:
And if as a startup, whether it be early stage, but as a startup you focus too much on those marginal differences between groups of people, you can run the risk of making big mistakes, which is making too many changes too soon and learning very little and adding crazy amounts of code complexity and overall organizational complexity to what you're building. And with Duolingo, because it was a consumer app, because we weren't dealing with a lot of regulatory issues, except for China where we had to watch out for certain words and phrases, in general, people want to learn a language and people learn a certain way and people use apps a certain way. So, there's a lot of commonality. We just found that by treating the world as one, and whenever we deployed an A/B test or tried something new in terms of marketing, we would just look at it as like, "Well, if this worked here, it will work there and we should just try it out everywhere," which meant every time I went and launched Duolingo new market, I got the same feedback.
:
Whatever country it was, "Here, it's different. People are different. You don't understand and what you're doing is not going to work and here's why you need to change." And if we had actually listened to that, it would cause all kinds of problems. In our country, we think that green is a negative color, owls are poorly seen as an animal, or here people think that free things are actually of low value, they like things that are expensive. Oh, people here really like free things and I'm like, "Everyone likes free things." They're like, "Oh, in this country..." Whatever, so yes, I think that countries are different, but it's more important to realize that people like to think they're different and people like to think their countries are different and highlight those because it makes them feel special, unique. We're all special and unique in all of our amazing ways, but this is not necessarily it.
:
And when you're trying to be super cautious of your resources, you have to ignore some of that because then you're able to roll out things once, which is important, but in addition to that, every new A/B test you want to run or every new hypothesis you have, if you now have a version of your app that's different in Mexico, in China, in India, whatever, you're going to have to run that test and whatever change you have in all of those versions, and then you just start having all of these different versions of the app everywhere and good luck managing that in terms of code, in terms of processes, in terms of personnel, in terms of costs, and most importantly in terms of time because now every single experiment or hypothesis is going to take you way longer to be able to deploy, and time is almost more important than money when you're a startup. So, it's important to keep things super simple, and this was something that we did that actually ended up paying off with few exceptions like India and China.
Lenny :
That is such cool advice. It reminds me of a quote that I think of that a friend of mine shared once, "Life is maintenance. Anything you add to your life is just something you're going to have to maintain from that point forward," and similar in products. Any time you add new code, you're going to maintain that code forever, and the more you can not add anything new and not make things really different, the easier everything gets. People forget that. It's like, "Oh, we're just going to spend a bunch of time to make it awesome in China or Brazil," and then, oh, they have to maintain that forever and every you feature has to...
Gina Gotthilf :
And it's an 80/20, so just focus on what will get you the 80 and not the 20. And then when you have the luxury of focusing on the 20, then you can.
Lenny :
So, speaking of different cultures and people being different but not that different, you pivoted your career basically to focus on Latin America. First of all, why did you decide to do that? That's a pretty unique path and what pulled you there?
Gina Gotthilf :
So Lenny, I don't see it as a pivot because as we were joking in the beginning, I've been an employee, I was an operator there at early stage startups and now I'm a founder and I'm a VC, so I'm still kind of in this little stack of roles that we have in our little tech ecosystem. And in my time working with Tumblr and my agency and Duolingo, I had the pleasure of speaking with entrepreneurs all over the world, in part because I started getting some media because of the work that I've been doing starting at Tumblr, so a lot of entrepreneurs reached out to me, but also because I became a mentor for an organization called Endeavor, which is global. So, I started working with entrepreneurs in Japan and Brazil on my free time, just mentoring. And I know that the opportunity for growth in terms of tech in Latin America is huge because first of all, the opportunity for growth in tech is huge all over the world, meaning there's just more and more to do.
:
There's more pieces of our lives that can become more efficient or better or cheaper by making them digital in some way, shape or form because digital products scale. We are behind when it comes to that in terms of Latin America, and our economy is also not doing super great right now. There's a number of things that make it tougher to succeed in Latin America, but make the outcome of potential success much higher. And simply put, there's a lot of low hanging fruit because a lot of what has already been digitized and productized in the US and more developed markets just hasn't in Latin America. And every time I took these calls, I would think like, "Well, this is not very efficient for me to be doing this one-to-one call. I feel very good about myself, I feel great, and this entrepreneur learned a lot, but I wish I could do this more at scale."
:
And also it doesn't seem like this is what's going to help this entrepreneur succeed. Maybe it's a little bit of advice, but it's like... And not only that, but I had a lot of experiences where I would mention something about growth that I had learned and that would blow the entrepreneur's mind. And I would think, "Why do I know this, but not this entrepreneur who honestly is smarter and more ambitious than me?" Oh, it's because I've had a career in Silicon Valley. It's because I've gotten to work with some of the best people in the world and I have access to this information just free flowing in my way all the time, and we take it for granted. So, how can we make this more accessible to Latin America's entrepreneurs, so that they can have access to that? What else is hard to get access to that could really get in the way?
:
Oh, like access to capital. So, what's the VC in the angel ecosystem looking like and what can we do that can actually impact that at scale? And then there's other pieces of the ecosystem that are missing, like if you're going to start a company, you have to incorporate it. It sounds super boring, but Brazil is one of the countries that takes the longest time to incorporate a company in the world, but then if you're going to get investment, you probably can't get investment in your Brazil entity because investors are like, "I don't know anything about Brazil, and sounds like a lot of employers get sued by their employees and lose," which is totally true, "And there's all this liability. I feel much more comfortable investing in a Delaware company." So then entrepreneurs are like, "Oh man, now I have to create this entity in Delaware. I don't even know where that is and what's the C-core? What's this other thing?"
:
So, there's just stuff that needs to happen for Latin Americans that we don't think about here, "Silicon Valley" talking about it as in the cloud in the US and developed markets, but also then you're able to raise money, how do you get money down to your country? That's not simple at all. How do you think about the FX transactions and not get screwed in the process and who's going to do it? And so anyway, there's a number of these things that make it super hard. And so, that's some of the problems that we wanted to solve.
:
Why it matters to me? I'm Brazilian, I'm Latin American, and I know that I had all of the opportunities in the world. I went to an American school, I got to go to school in the US, I got to work with some of the best tech companies in the world, and 99.9% of people in Latin America will not have these opportunities. And so for me, if I don't use this privilege to somehow make a huge impact where I came from, that will last, then I kind of wasted my life. So, that's why this matters so much to me, and I met my co-founder, Brian Requarth at On Deck. If you've heard of On Deck before, I'm a big fan.
Lenny :
I'm wearing On Deck socks right now. Yeah, I am.
Gina Gotthilf :
I love their socks, and I just had a conversation with them yesterday. I am a big fan of what they built. I met Brian doing On Deck... I actually was thinking of starting a completely different company, but also focused on community. As we were talking about, people want to find connection, and I think that there's a lot of business opportunity there, but I met my co-founder and he was working with our third co-founder, Yuri, who was actually the guy... We joke he's the guy who builds things.
:
He's the CTO, he actually knows how to build and started talking about what it is that we can do to make an impact in the speed at which tech startups succeed in Latin America because we think we can have a huge impact on the GDP of the whole region, developments, job opportunities, and so on and so forth. So to me, that's what motivates me. It's like figuring out how I can use my time as leverage to make the biggest impact possible in terms of socioeconomical mobility for people in the world and focusing on the part of the world that I came from made the most sense.
Lenny :
So you referenced this company, that you started Latitud. Maybe just describe briefly, just broadly, how do you pitch what Latitud does to folks that might find it useful?
Gina Gotthilf :
I will, and I still do a pretty bad job with pitching it, but the pitch is basically we're building the operating system for Latin American early stage tech startups, and what that means is that building a startup is hard anywhere, but it's extra hard in Latin America for some of the reasons that I outlined. Some of the things that we decided to solve for are one, it's super lonely to be a founder. And if you're able to meet great founders who are just a step ahead of you in anything, be it in product or growth or marketing or incorporation or finances, you can save yourself so much time from trying to read books and Google if they can just tell you what to do or connect you with the right person, that if we were able to connect these people meaningfully, we could make a huge impact.
:
So, that's number one, it's lonely. And number two, you build a startup in Brazil and you're like, "Wow, this is working. I'm going to go to Silicon Valley." I've seen this happen a lot in the past decade, and Silicon Valley is a completely different place. The US, it's a different place, the competition's different. 3% of people in Brazil only, and that varies in Latin America, speak English. So, the likelihood of you being taken seriously is low. Your chances of success are low, but at the same time, Latin America has so much in common as a region, but we don't actually actually see that if we're Latin Americans. We just think we're countries, especially Brazilians don't think that they're part of the rest, and Mexicans don't think about Brazil. It's so far, look at it on the map. In the US you're like, oh Latin America."
:
But if you're there, it's just not at all connected, but the opportunities of growth are huge and dependent on whether you meet the right people are able to open doors and understand that our problems are so similar that a solution for one part of this region could potentially be great for another part of the region. I'm not doing a great job of pitching, but in addition to it being lonely and it being difficult to find the right resources and really trustworthy knowledge, it's really hard to raise capital and it's really hard to do things like incorporate and bring your money down, et cetera. So, that's what we do. First, we have a fellowship program. We have 1,500 entrepreneurs who got in, we run four cohorts a year, about 600 applicants per, and so you get in and you get access to all of these resources we've put together.
:
You get to find out what everyone thinks about other investors in the region because I think it's important to disseminate that information. You get access to introductions to investors through each other and advice and events. In addition, we have a fund, so we've invested in 100 startups and we're raising our second fund now. It's going to be around $25 million with a $30 million cap, so that's another thing. So we invest, you figure out your investment game, but you might become one of our investments as well. And in addition, we have products that make it a lot easier to navigate the super, in my opinion, boring and frustrating stuff behind starting a company that you don't want to think about it as an entrepreneur because you're trying to solve a problem and build a team and build a product.
:
You're not trying to figure out what's the best incorporation method and how to open a bank account in the US and how to figure out the foreign exchange prices and bring the money down and how to manage that money or how to stay compliant in your country, and then in two other jurisdictions, if you have a Delaware and a Cayman. So, we do all of that for you and make it easy through a dashboard we built, a bank that we built, and so on and so forth. So, it's not an easy to describe business because it's kind of an ecosystem play. We're trying to elevate the tech ecosystem in Latin America, and it's a lot of moving parts.
Lenny :
You basically help them do everything, which is what I'm hearing, and it sounds like you'd be a fool not to take advantage of this. The customers essentially are founders in any Latin America country, is that right?
Gina Gotthilf :
Founders in Latin America, but we also have a lot of US-based founders who are building for Latin America because they understand that the opportunity there is huge.
Lenny :
Awesome, and then what is the arrangement? Do you take equity if they join the program? Is it free?
Gina Gotthilf :
We don't, joining the program is free. You just have to be able to get in. For a number of reasons, we just don't want to deter anyone who's amazing from being part of this community, and so that's why we made that decision. If we invest, we take equity. If you choose to use our products, that's a paid thing. So, you can choose what makes sense for you.
Lenny :
Something I wanted to ask about is what is it that Latin American founders and companies are uniquely good at? Is there kind of a thread across Latin American startups that are like, oh, they're so good at this area, pay attention here?
Gina Gotthilf :
In general terms, startup founders have to be really scrappy and resourceful and resilient. Latin Americans tend to be very scrappy, resourceful, and resilient because of just the realities in which we were brought up in. We have words for that that we don't have in English and Portuguese in Spanish, which is like dancing around things and figuring out things when you don't have other solutions. So, I think that's something that we see a lot. In terms of what we're really good at, I would say first of all, there's opportunity in every single vertical in Latin America because it's such a wide open field, so there's opportunity everywhere.
:
It's not that we're particularly good at FinTech, for example, but if you look at the FinTech opportunity in Latin America right now, it's so hot and there's so much money and there's so much happening because of the huge problem of people not having access to bank accounts or access to credit, or just all of the bureaucracy that exists in trying to get those things or to make payments and so on and so forth. So, there's just huge opportunity there. I'm trying to think what else-
Gina Gotthilf :
So there's just huge opportunity there. Trying to think what else I would highlight. Ah, Lenny, you talked about B2C. I think again, because there's so much open field, there's so much opportunity when it comes to B2B, especially when you're talking about SMBs. There's a lot of small and medium businesses doing things on paper, so figure out what they are and how you can make them not on paper and deploy them effectively. So I think that's an advantage we have.
:
Other than that, I wouldn't highlight anything in particular. I think that there's amazing people all over the world. It's just a matter of what are the opportunities that exist. And because there's so many opportunities that are Latin America specific or that are emerging market specific, which means that if they work in an emerging market in Latin America, they could work in other emerging markets. And you know what? Most of the world is not developed markets and understanding what it's like to not have access to amazing wifi and iPhones and all the things that we have access to, that can be a huge advantage because that's the reality that most of the population lives in. And that's a huge TAM.
Lenny :
That makes me think about WhatsApp. And one of the reasons they made it is they were just obsessed with making the app incredibly small and fast. And they started, I think with international markets and then that just ended up being an amazing app so fast and so easy to use.
Gina Gotthilf :
And still, and now there's things being built on top of WhatsApp. We just invested in a company called Leadsales, and they basically turn your WhatsApp into a CRM, which is amazing because so much business is being done on WhatsApp, and that's not the case here in the US. So you want to understand that you can build something for that. And there are other markets that are using WhatsApp for which that's also going to be useful. And the other thing is I think that emerging or developing markets tend to sometimes skip over things because we're so behind.
:
So for example, there's examples of these in India and in some countries in Africa where, I don't know, the desktop was skipped, people just went straight to mobile. I think we can see these catapult opportunities because then when you start building something and you didn't even build for the previous version of whatever it is that was being used because in the US or more developed market, you had access to them, then you are in a way at an advantage. So I'm excited to see how that plays out in the next few years, and I'm particularly curious to see how that plays out when it comes to AI.
Lenny :
One last question around Latin America. It's going to be a broad question. What do you think people should be paying attention to, whether it's specific companies you want to call out, big companies that are doing great or just trends or patterns, what do you think people should be paying attention to? Anything you want to shout out?
Gina Gotthilf :
Lenny, the truth is I would love to call out all of our portfolio companies. I believe in all of them, and there are some of them that are growing incredibly impressively. One of them is Pomelo, which is a FinTech platform for FinTechs that is just grown incredibly. To me, it's more about paying attention to Latin America. I think for the US, that's already a lot. I don't think people know what's going on below the border, I have no idea what Brazil is like, but paying attention because it's not just a place that's behind and trying to catch up. It's a place where the opportunity to make a lot of money exists. It's a higher risk region because of all the political and economic instability. But given the scenario that we're in right now, which is that we're still behind in terms of all the solutions that we know will be built to give people access to health, to education, to financial services, et cetera.
:
But we actually have a lot of money flowing into the region in terms of venture capital. We have the best talent we've ever had because now we've had, I forget how many, but a lot of IPOs that came from Latin America and unicorn companies, people who have worked at those companies or who have worked places like Duolingo are coming back to build now, know what they're doing. And so there's a number of things that have come together that make now a really exciting time to build a startup in Latin America and to scale it. So from an investment perspective, I just think that there's a lot of hot opportunities now in terms of knowing what's a good opportunity versus not. I think the same rules probably apply to those anywhere else, which is most importantly, the entrepreneur. Does this person know what they're talking about?
:
Do they have an unfair advantage in terms of knowing what a problem that exists and knowing how to solve it in a way that others couldn't do? They have access to the best talent in the world, not just in the region that will actually join them and build the best thing possible. And yeah, what's the TAM? And not just what they put on the slide, but what you actually believe the TAM to be. So that's what I would say. I think everyone's looking at FinTech and Latin America right now. It's hot, it's profitable. Money is where the money is, but I'm super excited about what happens with health and education in particular because I think that that has the power to truly transform the region in a massive way.
:
At Latitud, I think I mentioned in addition to FinTech, we tend to invest a lot in B2B SMB platforms that are helping businesses scale and work more effectively because there is a huge need for that and there's an opportunity to build. And I think that that can have an impact on the region. So I think that would be my advice. It's a little broad, but other than that, if not, I would just now sit here and tell you 15 companies that we love at Latitud and I won't.
Lenny :
Well, we can point people to your portfolio page on your website.
Gina Gotthilf :
I would love to highlight our portfolio companies. Maybe I'll just send you a list or something. I don't know.
Lenny :
Perfect. We will figure out a way to share that. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Gina, are you ready?
Gina Gotthilf :
I'm ready, Lenny.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Gina Gotthilf :
The one book I recommend because I truly, it really changed the way I think about things. It taught me a lot about a discipline I had never really thought much about, but also because I think it makes me sound smart and it's a really short book, so it's easy to get through is The Design Of Everyday Things. For me, that was the first time that I realized that design wasn't just this sort of cool thing that some people were into and they had to get and it made things beautiful. It was about understanding how everything is designed and how to think about design and usability.
:
So for someone like me who didn't have any experience in product before, I think it could be transformative. And then the second book, it has nothing to do with what we do. I recommend Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning because at heart I'm a philosopher and I tend to think a lot about life, the meaning of life and what differentiates one life from the next and how to live a good one. And no matter what profession we choose that continues to be important. So those are my recommendations.
Lenny :
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoy?
Gina Gotthilf :
So first of all, I love Succession, but I don't think we have to go into that. One that was recommended to me by a friend who I very much admire was Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram is How to with John Wilson. It's a really weird TV show that I would've never found if it wasn't for him. But the premise is basically this guy, I think he's a filmmaker and he's awkward and it's cool that he's awkward. It's just his style and he decides to make a TV show about creating to help people who are really worried or scared of doing something and helping them prepare for that moment in their lives.
:
So for example, someone is really scared of telling their friends that they lied about how many college degrees they had or whatever that they said they had a master's degree, but they didn't. And it's now been five years and it's not the debate club, but I forget what it is, but something that requires some sort of intellect and he doesn't want to confront the group. And so he recreates everything that could possibly happen that day in order to make this easier. Or another one about having kids. Someone's really scared about making the decision about whether or not they want to have kids. So it's kind of a documentary, but it's not. It's awkward. It's weird, but it's so good. And then I would say White Lotus, just like so good.
Lenny :
I do that song to my new child often because it's so funny.
Gina Gotthilf :
My husband and I do it at home.
Lenny :
Lot is a recurring,
Gina Gotthilf :
Yeah,
Lenny :
Yeah. I'm not going to do it, but it's a recurring favorite on this podcast. So we had a short drinking game where every time someone said, White Lotus, we drink. So I'm going to have some tea here real quick.
Gina Gotthilf :
Okay. I'm sorry to be predictable, but like I said-
Lenny :
No its great.
Gina Gotthilf :
We humans are a lot more similar than we'd like to think. What's amazing Lenny is just my realization more and more of how much this is true because I like to think of myself as unique much like everybody else. And then I started seeing that all of these really creative decisions I made are what all of the other millennial white girls did. It's just fascinating. Oh, I like whatever, mid-century modern furniture. Oh, you know what? Actually, I'll tell you what movie is my favorite one? Bo Burnham's Inside. I love-
Lenny :
Oh my God,
Gina Gotthilf :
I don't know if that's a movie, but I'm in love with Bo Burnham. My husband knows about this. I know all of the songs and what is it? White Girl's, Instagram? White Woman's Instagram. Such a good song. That's what I'm talking about.
Lenny :
Also, I've been re-listening to How is the best case scenario, Joe Biden,
Gina Gotthilf :
They're going to make me vote for Joe Biden. I was singing this to my parents. They didn't get it.
Lenny :
That's amazing. We'll link to that video, that movie. It's even after COVID, it's incredible. Anyway, I was actually going to say that first show you mentioned, I think it's called The Rehearsal, maybe there's a different title.
Gina Gotthilf :
Oh my gosh, you're right. So he has two shows and one of them is called How To and the other one is called The Rehearsal. And you're right, I am recommending the rehearsal. I have also seen How To, which are shorter episodes where he films in New York and he just goes like How to find a parking spot. And then it takes him on this down a rabbit hole of how cars are made or parking in the city. But it's also very good. But I prefer The Rehearsal.
Lenny :
And Nathan Fielder's the guy behind all this who's incredibly hilarious. He has a new show, actually I think it's on HBO with John Wilson or something that he's producing or it's this other guy. He's going around talking about stuff in New York and I think he's a producer.
Gina Gotthilf :
That's the one I'm talking about. That's How To with John Wilson.
Lenny :
Oh, there we go. So I think he's behind that. Okay, look at us. We're figuring things out.
Gina Gotthilf :
We are figuring things out. So I think he has maybe a new season.
Lenny :
Think season two. I haven't started that one yet. Anyway, here we go. We're going to keep going. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?
Gina Gotthilf :
Why do you want to work here is what I really like to ask because it tells me a lot. Of course, everyone wants a job. People could just be like, because I want a job and it seems like you guys pay well and whatever. I think this is a good next step in my career, but I want to know if this person knows what it is that we do, if they did a minimum level of research and if they connect with our mission because we're going to talk about mission a lot and I don't want them to gloss over it and to make decisions that are short-term thinking that go against our mission because of the reasons I mentioned with Duolingo. So I think that's one, it's not very unique, but I think gives you a lot of information. And then I would say, what are you world-class at and how do you know that you're at that?
:
And the second part is almost more important. What are you world class at? It's okay if someone says, look, I'm working on becoming world class at whatever, and this is why I think I'm great at it or whatever. But the second part is important because it tells me if people actually care about metrics, and I don't care what the metrics are, but just how do you know this to be true? It has to be more than like, "Oh, because my boss loves me," or "Because my mom told me," "because I gave a talk," or whatnot or whatever I want to hear, "I'm proud of having accomplished this." And maybe if you have some numbers to show, that's also really important.
Lenny :
What is a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really like?
Gina Gotthilf :
I have not been trying any products, I would say. So nothing to recommend. I would say though that I am very curious to try these gut health tests that are out there now or microbiome ones. I'm really interested in how little we know about our body and how tech can actually help democratize this information. And going on a tiny rant. I'm also feeling very resentful of doctors right now because we've always lived in a world in which doctors are sort of like these authorities and we must just believe whatever it is that they tell us, and we rely on them for information that is crucial to our survival.
:
But we're now in a world where we can Google things and that's even more scary because you have to know how to filter that information really well and you don't find explanations to things. But doctors don't like you Googling because they say it's scary, but also because they don't like being questioned. I think we're finally coming to a place where a lot of these devices that can give you great information about your body so that you understand your nutrition and very core things about ourselves that we don't today are becoming accessible to a lot of people just to the population. It's still expensive but we're getting there, and I think that will be magical. So I will call out the company Levels by my friend Sam Corcos because I think that what they're doing is awesome.
Lenny :
Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you like to think about? Come back to share with other people.
Gina Gotthilf :
One is "This too shall pass." And I will tell you this one right now is particularly meaningful to me right now because I'm going through a really tough moment because I have long COVID and lost my taste and smell, and it might be long-term. So, but I think it applies to the A/B thing that I was talking about when everything in life is moments except for a couple of diagnoses. And so, "This too shall pass," is something I say to myself a lot. The second one is also not particularly motivational, but I really believe in it, which is, "Fake it till you make it." That's something I've held onto for a long time. And even today, I don't mean lie. I don't mean pretend to be something that you're not, but it's almost like a way to overcome imposter syndrome and by opening rooms for yourself to be who you want to become so that you enable opportunities to become that.
:
And I'm not saying lying, but early in my career, I did fake it until I make it from the point of view of not saying no to things. When companies were saying to me being like, "Hey, can you help us grow without a budget like Tumblr," right? I was 25, 26. I was like, "Yeah, and then go figure it out." And when Duolingo turned to me and said, "Hey, can you be head of growth?" And I didn't know what growth was and I had to Google and find Andrew Chen's blog, I read it and I found out and I just said, "Yes," and then kept going with that. So fake it till you make it as kind of that for me.
:
But even today I have a lot of imposter syndrome, which I actually think is not imposter syndrome, is just acknowledging that I don't know a lot. My team says I have too much self-deprecating humor that actually puts the company down. It puts me down. So fake it till you make it to me means knowing how to stand in front of your team or a reporter or Lenny in a podcast and almost like being that person that you would like to be or being your best self. You could call it whatever you want, but I think it can really help you get out of the little hole that you would put yourself into and limit opportunities for yourself.
Lenny :
Amazing. This question elicits so many interesting insights and stories. I appreciate you sharing all that. Final question. You majored in philosophy, if I'm not mistaken. I'm curious, do you have a favorite philosopher or someone that most influenced the way you think about the world?
Gina Gotthilf :
I use a lot of philosophy in my day-to-day, but it's not because I have deep knowledge, it's because I have light knowledge that I draw on that helps people think I'm smart and relates to ideas. I often talk about Theseus's ship, to me that allegory is one of the most interesting ones because it's about identity and building and whether if the allegory is like the ship-
Lenny :
No, please share.
Gina Gotthilf :
So Theseus is on this journey. I think he leaves Crete and he's going somewhere else and he's on a boat. And then over the course of the trip so many things happen. They've hit so many waves and they have storms that they have to replace planks, and re-sow the sail and by the time they arrive at the next port, nothing on the ship is the same as it was before. They'd replace every single plank. They'd replace all the masts, they've replaced all the sails. And so the question is, is this the same boat that left the dock? And to me, that's a really interesting concept around transformation and what it means to have an identity that exists over time, even when so much of us or so much of a company or so much of a country changes, and what is that core identity?
:
And to me that shapes I think a lot of ideas because it's a cool allegory and it resonates a lot. But yeah, so I would say at this point I embarrassingly have very cursory knowledge of philosophy. I could probably remember a lot of it if I went back to it, but I don't use it in my day-to-day, and I would love to take time off at some point and go study, but I'm also embarrassed to admit that I'm not a person who just finishes work is completely depleted and then wants to bury my face in a philosophy book. I would like to acquire all of this philosophy knowledge, but I want to watch White Lotus. Or if I'm going to force myself to work out, I'll listen to an audio book that makes me feel good about myself, and it's a fiction one.
Lenny :
I think this is actually a great example of exactly what you're talking about, where we change and we are not necessarily the same person we were. That makes sense that you're not obsessed with philosophy having finished that a while ago and now working on something totally different.
Gina Gotthilf :
Yeah, I think I still am because I consider myself to be very existential. I'm an atheist, so I like to find meaning. It's not like it doesn't exist so much for me, and I think about the big questions and I am interested in philosophy. I'm just not interested enough to make time and effort for it in my life right now.
Lenny :
As a hidden gem. At the end of this episode, I'll share, I'm also an atheist and I actually ran a website called atheistspot.com. It was like a Reddit for atheist news. I went to conferences.
Gina Gotthilf :
What does it do? We didn't see God again today, still no God to be found.
Lenny :
Yep. The funniest thing is we had Google AdWords on there and the ads were based on the stories around different religions, and it says all like christianmingle.com, the atheistspot.com. Anyway, Gina, we covered so much ground. What an amazing episode. I learned a ton from you. I'm so excited for people to hear this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?
Gina Gotthilf :
Yes. Okay. Thanks, Lenny. So people can find me online if you want to see just ridiculous posts. That's where my Instagram is, and my Instagram is impressive because I'm Gina on Instagram. Yes, I am just Gina.
Lenny :
Wow.
Gina Gotthilf :
So that's super impressive. You won't even find it when you look for me because you'll see all these other Gina's, but it's just at Gina. That's me. I do share some professional things as well there too, but I think it's my more entertaining channel. You can find me on LinkedIn. I'm a little more serious on LinkedIn. I have a photo with Obama, which will certainly impress you, so find me. Gina Gotthilf on LinkedIn.
Lenny :
So many stories we haven't covered.
Gina Gotthilf :
I know I'm Gina G on Twitter, and that's probably, you know what? I did a Harry Stebbings podcast and then that got me 600 followers on TikTok, but I've never posted, but maybe at some point. I feel self-conscious, but I think I could be a good TikToker because I think I'm amusing.
Lenny :
Well, you're not going to get followers by saying there's nothing good there. I think if you want people, they'll follow you. You should tell them it's going to be great there.
Gina Gotthilf :
Come see my amazing contact content on TikTok. I will definitely start posting it soon, and you can influence what kind of content will be there because I'm listening to my followers right now, and then how you can be useful. Look, if you know of an amazing founder in Latin America, if you are an amazing founder in Latin America, or if you are in touch with VCs who are interested in this, then definitely tell them about Latitud. You go to latitud.com. Do not misspell Latitud. It doesn't have an E at the end. That's because latitude in Spanish is latitud. However, it's also because we couldn't buy latitude.com with an E, but now that's what it is and it's grown a ton, so get in touch, join the fellowship, join our community. We're particularly useful by the way to us people who are interested in getting plugged into Latin America, because if you get in, you just meet all the top people in one fell swoop, and that helps you make friends relationships, find clients, find your business partners, and understand the ecosystem in a hacky way.
