Alexander Embiricos :
I think if you don't believe it, you can't will it into existence. So you need a balance.

This is your training data.

Is there a product you recently discovered you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be some kitchen gadget, tech gadget, a hat.

**I love how much we're learning about your personality hearing these recommendations. Nice protagonists, optimistic futures. I like the [inaudible 01**:

18:53].
Alexander Embiricos :
I think if you don't believe it, you can't will it into existence. So you need a balance.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This is your training data.
:
Is there a product you recently discovered you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be some kitchen gadget, tech gadget, a hat.
Alexander Embiricos :
Yeah, so I have been quite into combustion engines and cars. Actually, the reason I came to America initially was because I wanted to work on US aircraft, but now I work in software. And so for the longest time, I've basically only had quite old sports cars, old just because they were more affordable. And then recently we got a Tesla instead. And I have to say that I find the Tesla software quite inspiring. In particular, it has the self-driving feature. And I've mentioned a few times today, I think it's really interesting to think about how to build mixed initiative software that makes you feel maximally empowered as a human, maximally in control, but yet you're getting a lot of help. And I think they did a really good job with enabling the car to drive itself, but all these different ways that you can adjust what it's doing without turning off the self-driving. So you can accelerate, it'll listen to that. You can turn a knob to change its speed. You can steer slightly. I think it's actually a masterclass in building an agent that still leaves the human in control.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This reminds me Nick Turley's whole mantra is, "Are we maximally accelerated?"
Alexander Embiricos :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Feels like it's completely infiltrated everything at OpenAI, which makes sense, that tracks.
:
Two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often think about and come back to in work or in life that's been helpful?
Alexander Embiricos :
I don't know if I have a life motto, but maybe I can tell you about the number one company value from my startup.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Love it.
Alexander Embiricos :
Which is still something that sticks with me, which is to be kind and candid.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That tracks. Kind and candid. Wow, that's a great combo.
Alexander Embiricos :
Yeah. And we had to put them together because we, as founders, realized that we often would be nice and it wasn't actually the right thing to do. We would delay the difficult conversations and we were not candid. And so every time we would remind ourselves of this motto and then we would become more candid. And then six months later, we would realize that we were in fact not candid six months ago and we needed to be even more candid. So then the question is like, "Okay, how should we be candid?" It's like, "Okay, well, let's think of being candid as an act of kindness," but also think of that both in terms of doing it and willing ourselves to do it, but also in terms of how we frame it as people.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That is a beautiful way of summarizing how to lead well. What's the book about challenge directly but care deeply? Radical Candor.
Alexander Embiricos :
Yeah, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So it's like another way of thinking about Radical Candor.
:
Okay, last question. I was looking up your last name just like, "Hey, what's the story here?" So your last name is Embiricos, and I was talking at ChatGPT and it told me the most famous individuals with the surname are the influential Greek poet and psychoanalyst Andreas Embiricos and his relative, the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector, George Embiricos. So the question is, which of these two do you most identify with, the Greek poet and psychoanalyst or the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector?
Alexander Embiricos :
I think it's going to have to be the poet because he loved the island that our family's from.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wait, you know those people? Okay, this is not news to you. Okay.
Alexander Embiricos :
Well, I mean, it's an enormous family. But it's like Greek, so these big families, everyone's your uncle.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Love this. Okay.
Alexander Embiricos :
You know what I mean? My mother's Malaysian and also everyone is my uncle or aunt in Malaysia too, if that makes sense.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah.
Alexander Embiricos :
But yeah, he loved this island that the family initiated from. I believe, I don't actually know where that's shipping magnate lived, I think it was New York or something. But anyway, we all came from this island called Andros, which is a really beautiful place. And it's like there's more livestock there than humans. Not too many tourists go there. But I think part of what I think is really cool is he published a lot and a lot of his writing is about the beauty of that island, which I think is super cool.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow, that was an amazing answer.
:
Two more questions, where can folks find you if they want to follow you online and maybe reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?
Alexander Embiricos :

**I'm one of those people who has social media only for the purposes of having work. My phone turns black and white at 9**:

00 PM at night. But yeah, so Twitter or X, @Embirico. And yeah, if you post in r/Codex, I'll probably see it. So you can go there.
:
How can listeners be useful? I would say please try Codex, please share feedback, let us know what to improve. We pay a ton of attention to feedback. I think, honestly, the growth has been amazing, but it's still very early times, so we still pay a lot of attention and hope to do so forever. And also, I would say if you're interested in working on the future of coding agents and then agents generally, then please apply to our job site and/or message me in those social media places.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Alexander, this was awesome. I always love meeting people working on AI because it always feels like this very, I don't know, sterile, scary, mysterious thing. And then you meet the people building these tools and they're always just so awesome, and you especially, just so nice. And like the examples you shared, optimism and kindness, this is what we want to be. These are the kinds of people we want to be building these tools that are going to drive the future. So I'm really thankful that you did this. I'm grateful to have met you, and thank you so much for being here.
Alexander Embiricos :
Yeah, thanks so much for having me. This was fun.
Lenny Rachitsky :
