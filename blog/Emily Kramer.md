**My favorite TV show from this year was Yellowjackets on Showtime, which is kind of Lord of the Flies, which had a bunch of women. Lord of the Flies meets lost. It's really good. So it has Christina Ricci in it, the person who was in Casper and now in [inaudible 01**:

03:14] if you were a girl that grew up in the late 80s and 90s, you will know who Christina Ricci is, or a guy, any gender. I really liked Yellowjackets. I think it's great.
Emily Kramer :
And it was the first show in a while that I've been watching it where I like for the first couple of episodes, I wasn't on my phone half the time. So that's like my measure for, is it good? And then the best movie I've seen recently was we watched CODA, which I think it won some Oscars or something.
Lenny :
I think it won best picture.
Emily Kramer :
Oh, okay. So it wasn't the Oscar. So I'm really original in my picks here. I'm like, I just watched the Oscar Best Picture, I thought it was great. No, but CODA was like, I think I cried, or at least I almost cried.
Lenny :
No, I actually cried. Yes.
Emily Kramer :
Yeah, it's about a family who can't hear and then their daughter can hear and they become really interested in music. And there's the story of a family and they're a family of fisherman in Massachusetts, which my brother is a clamor in Massachusetts that's his job. Not his only job, but one of his job that he clams. So he doesn't quite have that fisherman vibe, but somewhat relevant. Yeah, really, really good movie.
Lenny :
And that last scene, powerful. Too much, I'm going to start crying.
Emily Kramer :
It's a good one, it's a good family story. Lenny is crying right now. He's just in tears remembering the movie CODA. Lenny is going to spend the rest of the day weeping. You won't get a newsletter next week. It's just because he is rewatching CODA.
Lenny :
It's going to be an emotional newsletter. Speaking of that, what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask?
Emily Kramer :
Oh, there's so many interview questions that I like to ask. I mean, one of the basic interview questions in marketing that I like to ask is just the company that you're working on, what's the product? Why is it better? Who is it for? It's the most basic positioning question you can ask, but a lot of people can't answer it. So that's a good one. And also if you're writing positioning at your company or if you're on marketing your company and you can't tell me what the product is, why it's better, who it's for, go figure that out if that's what the home page of your website should cover. In fact, the hero of your website and so many don't.
Emily Kramer :
A fun question that I like to ask. It's a mix of getting to know you but also seeing how you communicate is describe something, and I didn't come up with this question, but I really like it. Describe something complicated that you know well that others don't and describe it as simply as you can. And it's just interesting to hear what people pick. Most people pick things related to cooking which is really strange. I ask that question every interview for a long time just as the final question because you learn something about people. And so many people pick cooking.
Emily Kramer :
And I'm like, that's a good choice because I find cooking really complicated and I have no idea how to do it. So describe these various aspects of cooking to me. But that's always a fun one. There's other questions that I always ask like walk me through a project you've done recently from start to finish and I'm listening for things can you tell me the goal? And can you tell the audience? But those are more boring, so I'll stop there.
Lenny :
Awesome.
Emily Kramer :
What's your favorite interview question Lenny?
Lenny :
Oh no, I'm asking you questions here.
Emily Kramer :
I know I wanted to flip the lightning round back on you. Have you ever done your own lightning round?
Lenny :
I haven't but I'll answer the question I met away. I'm finding the most popular answer to this question is that second one you just gave which is teach me something I don't know. That comes up a lot in these answers.
Emily Kramer :
Yeah. Teach me something I don't know. This is a variation on teach me something I don't know. Because it's really about how simply can you communicate it. Teach me something you don't know comes across as a little, I don't want to say pretentious, but it's like it's overwhelming.
Lenny :
Well, I'll add a little flavor to it as they often say, you have a minute to explain something I don't know, something interesting to you. And so it kind of forces you to be simple about it. But I like the framing.
Emily Kramer :
Yeah. It's a complicated framing. And then sometimes what I'll do, especially if they're going to be someone that's going to be writing is I'll be like, okay, make it simpler. And then I'll have them describe it to me again simpler. And I've probably done that in one interview, I've probably done it four times. Which that part isn't super fun but it depends on the person. If I think they can handle kind of joking around, make it simpler. And if I think the topic's interesting, of course, and I'll like want to hear about something so over and over again.
Lenny :
Awesome.
Emily Kramer :
Yeah, I mean it's good to have interview questions that maybe teach you something about how they're going to do at the job, but also learn something about the person. And in a way that's not just tell me about yourself.
Lenny :
Final question, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?
Emily Kramer :
The word thought leader here is getting me down but I'll answer the first part of your question. As marketers, we love to paint the phrase thought leader. Some of the other marketer that I think are doing interesting things beyond just marketing is Ashley Meyer is someone who is a marketer who also has a fund now. She was comms at Glossier as well as she used to be at Box and things like that. And is big on Twitter, but she's just someone else who is a marketer in return fund manager. So it's always nice to have other people like that to kind of compare notes with.
Emily Kramer :
I think that Arielle Jackson from First Round is an amazing support system to founders and marketers at startup. So if you're a first round company, she's a great resource and I think she's just a great resource in general. I also think Kevin Lee, the head of Marketing and Oyster, he's an LPN in our fund, he puts out a newsletter and has a full-time job growing a rapidly growing marketing team. So I have a lot of respect. He's coming to speak to the people in a course that I'm running next week. So he's top of mind. But those are some people that come to mind.
Emily Kramer :
But I mean, I have a lot of marketers that I admire. I'm lucky that in our fund we have over 50 marketers so I have a pretty big arsenal of people I can go to just from that as well. So I lean on the people there for a lot of different things.
Lenny :
And you're probably going to be raising another fund, and I know you try to raise from marketers and so is that true? Anything you want to add there?
Emily Kramer :
If you're a marketer, we have a fund and we allow for lower minimums for marketers. One of my goals is I don't think there are enough marketers who are investors or know how to get into investing. And I know how much founders need marketing help, so love to encourage more people to get involved in investing and can be the on-ramp for that through our fund. So if you're interested in that at all, or a marketer who's interested in angel investing, I'm always happy to have that conversation with you.
Lenny :
Emily, this was everything I was hoping it would be and more. I feel like we've helped a lot of founders understand the fog of marketing and I think we are probably going to help a lot of PMs and marketing people work together a lot more effectively.
Emily Kramer :
Hopefully. The fog of marketing, marketing is the San Francisco of functions in a company.
Lenny :
Karl the marketing fog.
Emily Kramer :
Karl the marketing fog.
Lenny :
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Emily Kramer :
Yeah, I am on Twitter and LinkedIn just Emily Kramer, my name, pretty simple. You can find links to the courses that I run, to the newsletter, to our job board, to talking to me about angel investing as a marketer on our website mkt1.co. And that should set you off in the right direction. And we have lots of things going on to help marketers build out their teams and help founders build out their marketing teams. So if that's you and you're in a situation where you're mostly at a B2B company trying to build out marketing, get in touch with me through my website or through Twitter.
Lenny :
Amazing. Emily, thank you for being here.
Emily Kramer :
Thanks for having me. This was really fun and I'm looking forward to also having that guest newsletter come out with you and just getting Lenny Lennyaised. It's a weird phrase, I won't use that again.
Lenny :
Let's move on.
Emily Kramer :
We're going to move on. All right. Thanks Lenny.
