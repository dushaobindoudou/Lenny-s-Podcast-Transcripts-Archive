### Yeah. So I actually just read this really great book that is slightly tangential, but I thought it really applied to this type of basically getting people to align on decisions. It's by Chris Voss. He is this famous FBI negotiator. I think it's called Split the Difference

Negotiating As if Your Life Depends on It. Don't quote me on that.
Lenny :
I think it's Never Split the Difference, right? And then I think he's also got a masterclass which I've watched, which is really good.
Nickey Skarstad :
I actually haven't watched the masterclass yet, but it's on my list after reading the book. And a lot of it, I think, especially because he's an FBI person, I thought it was going to be very much, "You're going to do this." And it's all basically his whole approach is emp...

**Yeah. So I actually just read this really great book that is slightly tangential, but I thought it really applied to this type of basically getting people to align on decisions. It's by Chris Voss. He is this famous FBI negotiator. I think it's called Split the Difference**:

Negotiating As if Your Life Depends on It. Don't quote me on that.
Lenny :
I think it's Never Split the Difference, right? And then I think he's also got a masterclass which I've watched, which is really good.
Nickey Skarstad :
I actually haven't watched the masterclass yet, but it's on my list after reading the book. And a lot of it, I think, especially because he's an FBI person, I thought it was going to be very much, "You're going to do this." And it's all basically his whole approach is empathy, and it's repeating things back to you, making people feel heard, making sure that you're hearing why they maybe don't like your strategy, or why they think that's a bad OKR. And I think if you can spend some time just listening to your team and really understanding why is this not resonating, you can help guide people on the right path. Or you realize you're wrong. Good PMs are humble people, right? You're not always right. Not always going to be right. So how do you know when you're right and wrong is another good podcast that you should do with somebody else cause I'm probably not very at it. Yeah.
Lenny :
Good tip. I really like that.
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. But I think that helps. And the other thing is I love the concept of one way versus two way door decision making, right? If your team is making a really critical long-term decision that's going to be limiting to a lot of the future things that you could want or need to do, that is a one way door decision. And you should spend time really thinking about discussing it, getting feedback and buy-in from your larger community, from your leadership team, et cetera. If it is a two-way door decision, it's not going to make a huge impact, you can change it later if you need to, let your team cruise on those things. Because it gives people autonomy. It helps you move fast. And then it just makes sure that when it does come down to decisions that are harder to change longer term, then those are the moments you should spend time and really think about and discuss and debate, et cetera.
Lenny :
Do you have any examples or stories that come to mind of those sorts of decisions that you kind of help people just go for it, even though I may not necessarily agree?
Nickey Skarstad :
Let's see. Yeah. So one big one that we made at Airbnb that was pretty formative in early days was we came up with basically an articulation of what we thought a good experience was, and the standards that an experience needed to meet for it to be considered a good experience for us. And that was a many month long term project. And it was so important because we ended up building the product around it, building our policies around it, building how we educated our hosts around it. We had one moment in time to figure it out and get it right until it scaled everywhere. And so that was a true one way door decision where it was really hard to change later because we literally needed it to be relatively final.
:
On Etsy, there was some big decisions that were made at certain points in time around what can be sold in the marketplace, and how to think through what constitutes something that is hand made. Those were one way door decisions, right? It's really hard to change that later because it's going to influence all of the listings that you have in your ecosystem. And so I think really thinking through those types of things are important and really setting teams up to be able to pause and spend some time to get it right because it will influence the end product in a very real way.
Lenny :
How do you know if it's a one way or a two way door decision? Do you find that it's generally pretty obvious when you're making the decision, or is it sometimes like, oh shit, we should have thought about that more?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. I would say I think I'm good at this 80% of the time these days, just because I've seen it done wrong in a lot of ways. But I think it's a muscle that you build honestly, and you get better over time about thinking about second order thinking. And so it's starting to understand, all right, if I make this decision today, it's going to impact this next level of decisions and the next level after that. And that will cascade through our larger system.
:
A great book to read if you are a product person is Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows. It's just about really thinking through how systems work, and then you can start to extrapolate what is the second order effect of the system. And if you think about that through your own ecosystem, it starts to help you understand, all right, this is a linchpin in our larger ecosystem that we got to be really careful about if we're going to touch it or change it longer term. But I do think some of that it's muscle, you build it over time. You make a couple of mistakes sometimes, and then you have to realize the true consequences of those mistakes and you don't make it again.
Lenny :
Can we talk a bit more about the second order decision framework? I know you have a awesome newsletter post about this, and it was something I wanted to chat about. Is this a framework that PMs can use to make better decisions? And I guess how could they do that? And then maybe just describe a little bit more about just this concept of second order decisions, because it sounds really important.
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. Basically what second order thinking is is you being able to think beyond the decisions that you're making today. The decisions you make today will affect tomorrow's decisions and your ability to build on your decisions that you made today. And this feels very existential and meta, but why it's important is that, especially when you're building product, is there's a cost associated with your time of everything you build. Especially when you're building marketplaces or anything with UGC content. When you make a change today, and it impacts every single user in your ecosystem that then is going to act on that change, it's really hard to make those changes later.
:
Let's talk about Airbnb home listing as an example. Really thinking through what are the pieces of data or all the pieces of data in the system that we need to actually list a home. And then how do we use those throughout our whole system in different ways? And then anytime you have to change those things. So that could be little simple things like truncating the length of the title of an Airbnb home when it's listed on the platform. You're going to have mad hosts, you're going to have design changes that need to be made to make sure that they can actually display something in a different way. It gets just inherently more complex the more complex your system is. So that is probably a terribly described way of describing second order thinking.
Lenny :
That makes total sense. And that's something we dealt with it, sorry to interrupt, but that's like on the host team, we dealt with this question often of just any change you make and the listing flow is going to impact so much of the experience of a host and a guest. And so that makes total sense. Sorry, keep going.
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. No, and I think that forcing yourself and your team to think in that way is just a really good thinking exercise because it will save you time and it will save you money, a lot of money later, if you don't constantly have to rebuild things when you want to make changes to your system later. And that ladders up again into having a very clear vision and a strategy. Because what you're doing is you're starting to think on the long horizon. And so the decisions that you're making today are in service of that long horizon. So you can actually build in that direction and you don't constantly have to rebuild every time you're trying to change something.
Lenny :
On the second order thinking, sorry, I called it second order decision, but in this framework that you spoke of, how do you actually operationalize this concept? When you're planning, do you write out in the document second order impact that we should be thinking about, or do you do something else?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. So I think there's many ways to do this. If you have a spec-ed template or a piece of documentation that your team typically use when they're writing out product strategy or product requirements, et cetera, you can put a line in here to force people to think about it. I also think thinking about first principles and writing out first principles for the changes that you're making often are in service of second order thinking. Where it's like here are the things that we care about. Here's why these things are important. And we want to make sure these are baked into what we're building. Typically you'll write those through the lens of second order thinking.
:
Shopify uses first principles a lot in everything that they build. And this is something I took away from that way of working because it's extremely effective. If you can get teams to align on first principles early on, it saves you a lot of heartache later because you've got people to align way early days before you even got into the design process, or before you had to start thinking about how do we actually technically implement this.
:
And then the other way I would say is there's ways to structure or have thoughtful discussion around second order effects. That could be a brainstorm. You could use Miro to think about that. We're going to make these changes today. How do they cascade through our ecosystem? What are the gotchas or the things we need to worry about? And again, I think the more complex your ecosystem is, the more you are forced to do this. A lot of founders in early stage products don't think like this because they're so focused on the product market fit. We need to just get something that people are using. That then when they get product market fit, they realize when they get into scale mode, they didn't build something scalable, and they have to rebuild things which can actually really hurt them when they're trying to grow really quickly later on.
Lenny :
Yeah. Absolutely. Happens all the time. For principles, do you put those in to say the team strategy, like the quarterly strategy document? Like here's our principles for the quarter? Is that how you generally do that?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. I think that is a great place to put it. You can write them on the feature level too. So something that you're building, just getting clearer on here are the things that matter to us. Here's what we care about. We're going to design in service of these things. And here are the things that aren't that important. And again, those are the types of places in a product requirements doc where people will argue the most, which is a good thing because you're basically discussing and debating sort of foundations of what you're going to build before you get into the work of building it. And so those exercises are always a good idea.
Lenny :
Awesome. I love that. Okay. So going back, because I wanted to close this thread, you've come up with your vision, your mission, your strategy, your goals as a team. People start to align around it. What do you do to kick it off and get people on board and aware of the plan, and then to stay on plan with that strategy and not kind of be distracted by new priorities and shiny objects?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yes. Oh, the shiny object thing is very real. Good question. So for example, I just did this recently where I brought my team along through the OKR process for Q2 planning. They had a say in basically what we decided we were going to work on. It went up for leadership approval. We got approval. And my process was I used Loom, which is another one of my favorite products. It's just a really easy screen share and video recording tool that you can share with teams. And so I just recapped, "All right, here's what I presented to leadership. Here are the feedback that we got. Here's the strategic feedback that we got. And here are the changes we're going to make. Any questions, let me know." And I posted it in Slack.
:
So I was just trying to keep the feedback loop really quick and tight with teams rather than wait till the next meeting you have with them a week later. I was like, all right, I'm going to just try to spend five minutes recording this and get it out ASAP. And that helps because then it gets people excited. Okay, cool. This thing that I worked on got really great feedback from leadership, and now we're working on it. I'm excited to get going.
:
And then it depends. Usually depending on the project, I have some sort of kickoff. I don't usually do a quarterly kickoff or anything like that because I think there's usually disparate teams owning different parts of strategy. But usually having a good weekly team meeting where you're really thoughtful about cascading feedback down from leadership, constantly checking in on what are we trying to do here? What is our strategy? How are these goals that we set laddering up? Are we achieving it? Are we not? Whatever. Having a meeting like that where you're kind of constantly talking about it each week also helps people feel bought in and not get distracted.
:
And actually I found that teams who are very bought to your vision and strategy are less distractable. Where I usually have more trouble is with leadership that aren't necessarily in the weeds with your team every day. And I'll get an idea. "Have you thought about doing this one random obscure thing?" "Yes. However, it's not in service of this long term plan, so we don't want to do that right now because we don't think it's the best use of our time."
Lenny :
Got it. And the way you're describing it, this is as a manager of product managers-
Nickey Skarstad :
Yep.
Lenny :
... versus an ICPM? Cool. So as an ICPM, I imagine you would do a quarterly kickoff, or whatever your cycle length. You kick off with the team. Here's what we're doing. Any questions?
Nickey Skarstad :
Totally.
Lenny :
Okay. Another thing I wanted to make sure we have time to chat about is product review meetings and process. Just kind of like how do you, as a product leader, make sure that you're shipping great stuff that you're proud of and that your leaders aren't surprised by? How do you design just a product review and design process.
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. So I have a lot of strong feelings on product reviews. And it's because I've been in a lot of different organizations and I've seen a lot of bad ways of doing this honestly. And I think it also depends on the product that you're building and the team that you've created. So I don't think that there's one right or wrong way to do this.
:
Where I've seen them fail is when they happen at the function level, and they're not done or shared as a team. Typically it's normal to have a design review or to have some sort of technical review. And the more you can try to bring those different review processes into one central moment to check in, the better it tends to go. Because what happens is you'll have feedback in a vacuum. The design leader will give the designer feedback, and then you don't hear about it. Or there'll be some technical flaw that happens in a very specific technical review that doesn't get back to the larger team.
:
So finding ways to make sure that those parts of your process are shared across each function, and you attend them and prepare for them as a team, I think really helps a lot of that. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a design review. Of course you should. I mean, you should just be really thoughtful about having moments, especially if there are moments where you're blessing something to move forward, to making sure the whole team is there. And that there's a very strategic check-in process to get those things approved that everyone knows about and is a part of.
Lenny :
Is that a meeting that you do weekly and you invite the designer and the engineer? Who do you invite, I guess, and what is the goal of that meeting? The goal of that meeting, I imagine, is approved the product to go launch and build.
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. And I think especially going back to the one way, two way door moment, giving teams autonomy to ship some things that you think are two way doors and aren't necessarily mission critical are important to your vision, but aren't going to conflate with the larger system, I think trying to keep things quick and not have too many barriers for people to ship is incredibly important. So you'll have to figure that out for your own org and it's nuances, but that is something that is important.
:
But when there are moments where you think it is basically a feedback gate, where it's a gate you need to walk through and a specific moment in time where you've gotten feedback, I think having a cross-functional meeting where there's a clear pre-read or something that's sent before. It's like, here's what we're talking about today. And then aligning on, do we think this meets our goals and does this meet our quality bar? And doing that in a really thoughtful way just so the team gets feedback. So the leadership is plugged in, but also so you're not standing the way of people shipping their products.
Lenny :
And then do you check in throughout the process of the product being built, or do you kind of encourage teams to get to a point where it's basically ready for approval?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. Ideally in a perfect world, there's three check-in moments. There is the first principles check-in. What are you trying to build, or what are you trying to do? What are the sort of foundations that you're going to build on? What is the most important thing? What are you solving for? Getting approval on that, weirdly, is almost the most important thing. Because it saves a lot of teams a lot of time when they get later in their feedback review process and people are like, "You're not solving for the right thing." So that's important.
:
Once you've aligned on that, then it's like, all right, what approach are we going to use? What are we going to build? And that's sort of how we solve the problem. Making sure that there is a technical component there too so there's some sort of infrastructure review or architecture review, or whatever you want to call it. And then it's like, all right, this is ready to ship. Let's check in again. Do we think it's ready? And I think that, again, it depends on your organization. If you have a very small team, you might be very plugged in and these things might not need to happen. But in bigger organizations, especially where leadership isn't always able to be in the room, making sure that you have a clear checking in a few times to make sure that everyone is moving in the right direction and everyone feels good is, I think, a worthwhile exercise.
Lenny :
I love that. Such a simple framework. And then one last question along those lines, do you leave it up to the team to schedule these meetings, or are you pulling it out of them and making sure they schedule it?
Nickey Skarstad :
Today, because the team that I'm working on is pretty small, and we're pretty pre-product market fit, we're not doing a ton of very formal check-in moments because we don't need to be. Because it's a small team and we're all cruising together. But in bigger orgs that I've worked in, for Shopify, for example, there was a process around having these meetings and who would be there. And so those would kind of be scheduled through the larger processor system that they were working in, which really worked for them actually. And I think it allowed teams to be pretty autonomous on the day to day, but just making sure that there was feedback coming of from their users as well as from leadership.
Lenny :
Got it. One last question before we get to our exciting lightning round. And it's something that I've been thinking a lot about recently, which is around remote work as a product manager. I left Airbnb before COVID, and so I never lived in this world of everything is remote and product managing remotely. Is there anything you've picked up or learned that has been really helpful to being a product leader in a remote world?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. I would say last couple years have just been a huge shift in my ways of working. I sort of grew up as a PM in IRL environments where we did the majority of our work together in the same room. So that was whiteboarding, having a quick sync after you had an in person meeting to finalize some details or keep hashing out a problem. It's so cheesy and overhyped, but the proverbial water cooler moment where you see somebody, and you're like, "Hey, how are you doing, Hey, did you hear about this thing?" All of those things literally went away overnight.
:
And I think especially the job of a PM, it's hard under normal times because you are doing so much labor to make sure people are informed and give feedback, et cetera. And then overnight you took away a lot of the methods that they were using to do it. And so I think that has been a pretty profound shift for a lot of people working in product roles.
:
The good news is there's a ton of new tools and new technology that's actually being built right now that's majorly helpful for this. So I use Slack in very new ways today than I did two years ago. Things like just making sure to post more asynchronous updates. Trying to actually take the burden off of an IRL or a Zoom meeting. Can we talk about this asynchronously and do it in Slack? Slack has this really great feature called huddles where you can just quickly get on. It's just audio. So there's no video. And you can just have a 30 second conversation. It's good for standups and things like that. Suggest you try it if you haven't yet.
:
And then a lot of the old in person whiteboarding, things like that, you can do those now using awesome tools like Miro and FigJam. And I feel like, especially at Airbnb, we had such an international team that there was always somebody who was remote typically. And I think we never really got the remote experience right. And now that the majority of our teams are remote, I'm a fully remote person, I've been a lot more thoughtful about making sure we're creating a really good experience of how we're working for the larger team. And so I think you have to hack on this with your team. Different teams have different ways of working, but trying to be a synchronous, using Slack, making sure you're following up in very visible ways where people can see. Don't rely on Zoom meetings to fill all of your time. Otherwise people will literally hate you. And things like that really make a huge difference.
Lenny :
Awesome. Super helpful. All right. Nickey, are you ready for the lightning round?
Nickey Skarstad :
I'm ready. Let's do this.
Lenny :
What's a book that you recommend most to other product managers?
Nickey Skarstad :
I love Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows.
Lenny :
Awesome. Okay. We're going to link to that in the description. Other than Duolingo, what's another company that you recommend the PMs go work at or explore when they're looking for a new gig?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah, I would say Etsy hands down.
Lenny :
And why is that?
Nickey Skarstad :
I think it's a great place to learn how to be a PM. Data driven, really supportive, product leadership, and a super fun product to build.
Lenny :
Awesome. Love that. What's the current favorite kind of app or piece of software that helps you do your work better?
Nickey Skarstad :
I'm obsessed with Superhuman, which is a email productivity app, which once you start using it, you can't not use it. You basically have to use it for the rest of your days. I also am obsessed with Loom, which is a video recording tool that makes it really easy to share really quick video updates.
Lenny :
Awesome, great choices. And then outside of work, what's a current favorite app or just piece of software that you love?
Nickey Skarstad :
Definitely TikTok. Short form video is very fun and entertaining. Can't get enough of it, and have been creating some myself. So I'm definitely hooked.
Lenny :
While we're on that topic, how do people find you on TikTok?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah, it's just my name. It's Nickey Skarstad, and give me a follow.
Lenny :
I'm a very happy follower. And then I'll link to that in description too. Who's a favorite person that you like to follow on either Twitter, or Instagram, or even TikTok?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah, so I love, she is a cultural journalist, her name is Anne Helen Petersen. And she's really plugged into sort of the larger cultural zeitgeist of the time. And I always give people, when people ask me my top advice for new PMs, it's just to be a consumer. To download new products, to try them out, to use all the things and try them because I think it actually makes you a better product builder. And follow people that are not just tech people on Twitter. You are doing yourself a disservice if your entire feed is tech people. So find people that are plugged into cultural zeitgeist because it helps you also understand the moment in which you are shipping, and it'll make sure that you're acing your product marketing and your messaging and you're building the right thing.
Lenny :
What's her name again?
Nickey Skarstad :
Her name is Anne Helen Petersen.
Lenny :
Anne Helen Petersen. Love it. Okay. And then final question. Who's been your favorite manager?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah, so I couldn't pick one person here, so don't be mad. But it's actually a lot of women that I worked for at Etsy. The majority of my entire reporting line the time that I was there was all women, which has never happened to me again. So shout out to Kruti Patel, who is their current chief product officer, a woman named Heather Jassy, who ran the community team at Etsy long ago, who was a true delight to work for. And then Linda Findley, who is now the CEO of Blue Apron, but she was the chief operating officer at my time at Etsy. And she was my boss for a bit. And she was wonderful.
Lenny :
Amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. And thank you so much for joining me, Nickey, for doing this. Where can people find you online? And then just generally, how can people that are listening to this be helpful to you?
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah, so I have newly become obsessed with TikTok, like I said before. I've been creating some fun, little short form videos. One of my regrets as a long time product builder is it's very time consuming to write down the stories of building products and to share them. But I found TikTok actually really easy to do that. So I'm going to try to experiment there a little bit more.
:
So you can follow me, I'm @NickeySkarstad on TikTok. And then I have a newsletter. I call it Builders. It's nickey.substack.com. Nickey is spelled like Mickey Mouse, but with an N. N-I-C-K-E-Y, .substack.com. And I publish their occasionally. I need to get it going again. But again, trying to write down more of the stories of actually being a builder who's been doing this for a long time. Because a lot of us don't have a lot of time to actually talk about it, but it's really interesting work and I want to share it more.
Lenny :
Awesome. I'm a follower and a subscriber to both. So highly recommend that.
Nickey Skarstad :
I love it.
Lenny :
And thank you so much, Nickey.
Nickey Skarstad :
Yeah. Thank you, Lenny.
Lenny :
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoy the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.
