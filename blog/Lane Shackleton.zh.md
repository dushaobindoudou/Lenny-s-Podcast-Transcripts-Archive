**They feel this the most because they're the ones that are driving decisions and really the ones that are driving discussions oftentimes in companies. And so I think the problem with one-way writeups I felt very deeply at Google and YouTube. And just to name them, the first one is you would always be trying to figure out who's read your write-up. So I have many memories of sending a write-up out at 11**:

30 PM and then waiting patiently for the avatar of the SVP in my area to show up in there. And that was a sign that they had read it, which is just totally insane if you think about that behavior. The second one is you end up having a lot of the discussion in the comments itself. So this is a space that's really built for grammar and spell checking and things like that. And you're having these really meaningful discussions in this a hundred pixel right margin.
:
And part of that I think is there are all these questions that are being raised, and so you have really no idea what the most important question is. And so if you're facilitating those discussions in one way writeups, you're often going through the comments in the 20 minutes before that session trying to figure out which one of these do I want to address. And then the other behavior, and I don't know if you've ever seen this in a doc, but in one way writeups that you see a lot is there'll be just a mega comment thread on the title of the doc. And people are like, "I don't think we should do this," or you'll get into this 30 comment thread on the title because that's the best place to put your overall thoughts. And I saw this pattern all the time. So if you live that life, I think the world of two-way writeups and the way that I think a lot of our customers are doing it, and you can do this on other tools besides Coda too, I think is quite a bit better.
:
I guess the alternative to go down that list is you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup. So now you can say, oh, these are all the people that have read this. And I think even you see a pattern in some of our customers where if it's a particularly long writeup, you'll have three done reading buttons so you can see where everyone has gotten to. And then the second thing is making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question. So instead of pulling questions out of the comments and trying to figure out which one to address, just putting those in a table and then letting people upload those. And that's what we call Dory. And then I think probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?
:
And if you think about the contrast between a comment thread on the title and seeing a list of all the sentiment, how everybody feels about this proposal and really being inclusive to the entire audience is just wildly different. I think in my particular experience. I'll give you one example. I wrote this proposal, this is now a couple years ago. I thought it was going to sail through no problem. I thought it was going to get four out of five and five out of five smiley faces from everybody. That's sort of how the sentiment table works. And one of the lead designers basically said, "One smiley face. We shouldn't do this." And I was like, oh man. This particular person's not really vocal in meetings. And so I would not have heard that feedback. It was very unlikely I would've heard that feedback unless they had had a sentiment table, a place to add that. And so I think the punchline on all of this is I really authentically believe that this is where we're headed and hope that a lot of PMs and product teams adopt this in general.
Lenny :
I'm so glad that we touched on it and there's a template or an explanation of this that you wrote up that we'll link to. Yeah.
Lane Shackleton :
Great. Yeah.
Lenny :
Awesome. Is there anything else that you think that we should touch on that we haven't touched on?
Lane Shackleton :
Yeah. I think one thing that we've discussed before is just about strategy and planning and stuff like that. So it may be useful to touch on a couple of insights there. I think there's two insights in the strategy and planning thing. And this is again in the handbook that we're writing, but the first that I end up seeing a lot is just this idea that OKRs are not actually strategy. So I think the way that we plan and the way that our customers plan, the key point is it's critical to disconnect strategy discussions from OKR discussions. And it sounds really obvious, but it's I think a very common mistake. And I think a really simple question to ask yourself is do we have a separate strategy process or strategy ritual that is distinct from OKR setting and metric setting and goal setting? And I have found you can pick whatever strategy framework works for you, but I do think it's quite important to pull those two things apart.
:
The other rule that we live by on the planning side is what we call a 10% planning rule, which is essentially just ensure that you're not for a given time period planning for more than 10% of that execution period. And I think this is a really easy mistake to make. I mean, this is a hard fought rule because we've made that mistake before. But you end up getting bogged down in planning or saying, planning felt rushed and so we need to make it three weeks instead of one week or whatever. And the byproduct of that over the course of a lot of time is that you end up just planning way too much and oftentimes you really don't know what's ahead until you've launched or learned something. And so I think that's a pretty good rule to follow.
Lenny :
I love that rule. I found the same heuristic. 10%. If you're planning for a week, plan for half a day, planning for a month, maybe like three days. Yeah, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Lane Shackleton :
I'm ready.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Lane Shackleton :
One that comes to mind is Turning the Flywheel. It's a little manuscript book. Jim Collins wrote it. It's really, I think a very succinct and very fast read about how flywheels work. We talked about Storyworthy. I recommend that book a lot. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy. Love that book. Very simple framework that I've reused a bunch. Maybe outside of tech, Waking Up is a book by Sam Harris on mindfulness that I really like. And then an old one that I really like is The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galway, which is a kind of classic.
Lenny :
Amazing. On Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, I'm working on getting Richard Rumelt on the podcast. I'm in talks with his agent and they seem to be excited. So we'll hope that actually happens. And then you inspired me to try to get the Storyworthy guy on. So what a cast of characters we're going to get on here.
:
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?
Lane Shackleton :
Yeah, it's a little bit hard with three kids and a job these days to watch a lot of TV. I would say I really enjoyed The Last Dance. I love any sports documentary. All those.
Lenny :
Have you seen Underrated, Steph Curry's new documentary?
Lane Shackleton :
No, I haven't. I got to watch that.
Lenny :
Ooh. It's really good.
Lane Shackleton :
I've been rewatching Arrested Development. That's also just a timeless classic.
Lenny :
Classic. I love that Michael Cera is in the Barbie movie, not to give any spoilers. That was a funny surprise.
:
Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?
Lane Shackleton :
There's two I really like. One is teach me something that I don't already know. I think it's just an awesome way of seeing if someone's going to lean in and really figure out what you don't know and then how passionate they are about pitching what they do know I think is really fun. And then Shishir and I have been asking a version of teleporter question and evolving it for many years now, so I like that question quite a bit.
Lenny :
Shishir shared that question in his episode and we make TikTok clips out of some of these conversations and that clip just went crazy. People love it. It's our most viewed clip, I think on TikTok. Or just like, what would your answer to that question, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes if you want to watch just that one interview question. I think you maybe gave it away, so maybe that's why you're evolving it.
Lane Shackleton :
Yeah. We-
Lenny :
Don't know if we screwed you.
Lane Shackleton :
I also recently wrote a post about my favorite ref check question, which I think I would love to learn other people's favorite ref check questions.
Lenny :
References check. Oh man. That's its own. Oh man, I'd love to do a podcast just on that. That is such an important skill. The first question you mentioned of asking people to teach you something, I heard the best version of that in a previous episode where Maya, the Head of Product for Spotify podcasts, asks what would your podcast be if you were to start a podcast?
Lane Shackleton :
I like that.
Lenny :
So feel free to steal it.
Lane Shackleton :
I sometimes do a version of making them explain it two different ways after, and making the candidate explain it two different ways and saying, "Okay, now you have to explain that to your grandparent." And then now you just told me about sewing or some hobby of yours. Now sell it in its most technical form to someone who knows everything about this particular topic. And so it's kind of fun to also see the range that people can operate.
Lenny :
Awesome. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? Either digital or physical, anything that comes to mind?
Lane Shackleton :
A few. I'm becoming a real sleep nerd, so those eye masks that cup around your eyes, I love. Obviously in the tech world, ChatGPT. I got really obsessed with tennis during the pandemic. There's a product called Swing Vision that's really good. It basically cuts up your match into different ... All of your forehands or all the longest rallies or all that and uses AI to do that. There's a corresponding meditation app to the book Waking Up that I really like. That one's a very good one.
Lenny :
We live not so far from each other, so we got to play some tennis and I could check out this very cool product.
Lane Shackleton :
Yeah, let's do it.
Lenny :
You're on. That'll be our sequel. Just our game. Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with people around you, share with your kids maybe?
Lane Shackleton :
I don't know if it's as motto as much as it's just a way of being. It's essentially the present moment is all that we have. Realizing that our attention is very often on the past or the future and in so many ways the present is where it should be always. And so I think that that is something I think about a lot. I think maybe more broadly, I had a mentor who roughly said a version of make things happen, and so I really try to apply that to anything that I do. If that's work or life or sports, I try to be the person who creates momentum and positive change and progress. And so I think that that's generally a good motto to live by.
Lenny :
Beautiful. What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught?
Lane Shackleton :
My mom's a psychologist and a professional counselor so certainly active listening. Maybe the tech version of that or the modern version of that is steal manning someone's argument, being able to repeat back to someone what they said in a better form, more clear form. So yeah, she's an amazing woman. Taught me a lot about listening.
Lenny :
Final question. You were a guide in Alaska helping people climb. If someone were to pursue climbing, is there a tip or a lesson or something that you think people should know to get better at this or to know before they go down this route?
Lane Shackleton :
There's a saying, which is the safest climber is the one who knows when to come down essentially. And I think that there are many times that you have to put your ego in check and come off a mountain or come out of a climb because it's not quite as safe as you thought it was. So I think that's maybe one. I think the other is it's probably not a one-way door. So I think in many ways you can do climbing and you can do some of these outdoor pursuits on the side, or you can always come back from them. So it's maybe not as big of a choice as some people think it is.
Lenny :
Lane, I said at the top of this episode, Coda has one of the most thoughtful product teams out there, and I think it'll be clear to people after listening to this why that's the case and where it trickles down from. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and ask you any other questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Lane Shackleton :
I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have a Substack. We'll be releasing that handbook for product teams that I will probably post on Substack. And in terms of useful to me, yeah, give Coda a try. Give us feedback. I love hearing from product people all over. It's one of the bright spots in my day to hear all the creative rituals that come from this community. You've created just a legendary community of people and so they always give very thoughtful feedback so I'm very open to all of that. And yeah, thanks for having me.
Lenny :
Awesome. Lane, thank you again so much for being here.
Lane Shackleton :
Thanks.
