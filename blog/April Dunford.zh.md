Yeah, to come on Good Morning America, do the thing and everyone's like, "Oh my God, we're getting flying cars." And then he comes out on the Segway and everyone's like, "What the fuck? That's not what we were promised, man."
April Dunford :

### So I think it is an utter waste of time for marketing to build these stupid little one pager persona things for these 17 million personas and treat them like they're the same as the champion, when the champion matters times a thousand and all we really need to do is figure out how to arm the champion, because the champion's going to do this, the heavy lifting of selling IT. We're likely not even going to get all that involved. Gee, that's my [inaudible 00

Lenny :
That was amazing. I've never heard it described so directly and clearly. And so I think that's actually a good way to just wrap things up. I feel like I've sucked up enough of your time. Where can folks find your book, contact you if they want to work with you, anything like that?
April Dunford :
Sure. The book's called Obviously Awesome, and you can Google me and find that wherever books are sold. And then there's an audio book, if that's your jam or an E-book or whatever. And t...

41:33]-
April Dunford :
Yeah, to come on Good Morning America, do the thing and everyone's like, "Oh my God, we're getting flying cars." And then he comes out on the Segway and everyone's like, "What the fuck? That's not what we were promised, man."
April Dunford :
And the interesting thing about this Segway was that refusal to position it at a micro level, left it up to the customers to decide what it was. So even when we saw it was like, "Okay, so it's human transport. We get that, but what should I compare it to? Should I compare it to a car or a bicycle?"
April Dunford :
And so a lot of the early users were saying it was the worst thing to have a Segway because nobody knew where you were supposed to drive it because they didn't know what it was. So if you were driving on the road, cars were honking at you and they're like, "Get that stupid thing off the road." But if you drive it on the sidewalk, then the ladies with the baby strollers are like, "Get that stupid thing off the sidewalk."
April Dunford :
And the thing was a colossal failure eventually. The patents are still amazing. The patents just got sold last year or the year before to some company that does these hoverboard things. But the tech was way, way ahead of its time, but there wasn't good positioning to answer the question, who's this for? Why do they care? So what?
Lenny :
That's a really good segue to a question I wanted to ask you is when-
April Dunford :
Segue, ooh.
Lenny :
Wow. Unintentionally intended. When does it make sense for a company to bring in someone like you to go deep on positioning?
April Dunford :
I think most companies can do positioning on their own. That's my belief. Some companies I think lack a methodology to follow to go do it. So I wrote a book called Obviously Awesome, and that was the purpose of that book. If you want to do positioning and you just want to start a little exercise and do it yourself in house, you can use my methodology and my way to do it. And I think most companies can get it done that way.
April Dunford :
But most of the ones that come to me have attempted to do that and it hasn't worked out for one reason or another. So sometimes it's because, and this is not unusual in startups, we got an executive team full of A type people and we're all pretty opinionated and we just can't get to agreement on stuff. And it makes a lot of sense to bring an outside person in to help facilitate that conversation, particularly one that's got a lot of experience in positioning.
April Dunford :
So sometimes I get brought in for that reason. Other times I get brought in as companies just feel like they really got to nail it because there's a lot at stake. I've done a lot of work with companies that they're about to hire 10, 15 people in sales or they're about to make a really big investment in marketing and they just want to make sure they really nail it and not have to maybe do a not so great version and then redo it and then redo it again. If you bring me in, then we're going to nail it. There's no way we're going to get to something that isn't good.
April Dunford :
So sometimes people bring me in because they feel like there's a lot at stake. And those are generally the companies that bring me in. Some bigger companies I think bring me in, again, a bit more of a security blanket. We know we could do it ourselves, we kind of got it ourselves, but we'd feel better if we had the expert in here just to make sure we nail it once and we don't have to come back and do this again right away.
April Dunford :
So those are the kind of companies typically I work with, but I think a lot of companies could get it done with my book or some methodology, get the gang together and just bang it out themselves. I think everybody should start there.
Lenny :
That's awesome. How long should it take to do this kind of process either on their own and then with you? How long do these things take?
April Dunford :
Well, so the work that I do, we do it as a week long sprint. Now there's a bunch of prep that happens before that and there's some stuff we do afterwards, but the actual exercise itself is a series of sessions spread out over a week. I've seen companies do it on their own and they do it in a couple of days. They trap everybody in a room over a couple of days.
April Dunford :
Assuming you've got the right information to go and start with it, it shouldn't take you too long. And it really depends on how contentious things are because again, what you're trying to get to is agreement and alignment across the team. You're not done until everybody thinks what we've come up with is good.
Lenny :
So it sounds like you work mostly with larger companies and later stage companies. I mentioned this to you before we-
April Dunford :
Yes and no.
Lenny :
Okay. Okay.
April Dunford :
Yes and no. It depends on how you define that really. I've done a lot of companies that are around 5 million revenue, 10 million revenue in there. So they're beyond seed stage, but I wouldn't call them a large company quite yet.
April Dunford :
But I will say this, I do get a lot of calls from companies that are super early stage and where I don't think they're ready to actually really ... Well, they're not ready to bring in someone like me, and I think in general, they're not ready to really over tighten their positioning.
April Dunford :
So I think about it this way. So I've got this new thing, I'm either about to launch it into market or I've got it in market, I've got a handful of customers. At that stage, what I think you've got is a positioning thesis. And so the best thing you could do is deliberately go through a positioning exercise, document the thesis.
April Dunford :
And so the thesis says, we think we compete with these folks. We think this is differentiating. This is the value we think we can deliver that no one else can. These are the people we think are going to get really excited about that. Therefore, this is the market we're going to win. But it's just a thesis.
April Dunford :
And so internally it's good for us all to be in alignment internally, but when I go to launch that externally, if I don't have any customers yet, it's very likely, and in my experience, 100% of the time, the thesis is partially incorrect. It's based on a bunch of assumptions and our best guess at it, based on what we did in customer discovery or all our research we did before we built the thing.
April Dunford :
But we always, we're never a hundred percent correct. And so in these cases, I actually think it's better in the early days of a product to keep the positioning a little bit loose and allow the market to pull you maybe in a direction that you didn't think it was going to.
April Dunford :
So here's my terrible analogy I use all the time, but I'm going to use it here. But it's like I designed a fishing net and my thesis is this thing's amazing for tuna. It's a tuna fishing net. It's the world's greatest tuna fishing net.
April Dunford :
So I could launch that and say, "It's just for tuna, only tuna. Don't use it if it's not tuna." And maybe it works for tuna, maybe it doesn't and I don't really know. And if it fails, it fails hard.
April Dunford :
A better way I think is we know internally that it's the tuna fishing net. That's why we built it. That's what it is, but let's just at the beginning, let's put it out there and keep it a little loose and we say, "It's a net for fish, big fish, all kinds of big fish, any kind of big fish. And then let's just see, let's let the fishermen try it out. Let's see what they pull up."
April Dunford :
And maybe what we discover is, you know what? This thing's actually amazing for grouper and we just didn't know, because we're not grouper people. We didn't really think about grouper. And then once we've got enough of that signal and we start seeing the pattern in who loves our stuff and why, then we can really tighten it up and run at that market.
April Dunford :
But at the beginning, I think it's actually okay if your positioning's a little bit loose. And so I think you can worry too much about positioning in the super early days of a product when it's impossible to tighten it up, because you just don't have the data to do it.
Lenny :
I know that you touched on this a bit, but what does that transition look like between, okay, it's okay to keep it loose and see where the market pulls to, okay, we got to start taking this seriously? Is there a trigger that's like, okay, let's get into this?
April Dunford :
Yeah. It's one of those things that usually like you know when you know. But what you want is you want to start feeling comfortable that there's a pattern and it isn't just like, hey, I got one customer in this segment and one customer in this segment and one customer in this segment and I don't really know.
April Dunford :
What it usually starts at the beginning is it starts with, you'll say, "Gosh, all kinds of people like our stuff. All kinds of people like our stuff for all kinds of different reasons." And if you're seeing that you don't see the pattern yet.
April Dunford :
And eventually what happens is the pattern starts becoming clear that it's like, oh, all those customers look differently but there's actually this thread through them. Look, they all have the same marketing automation tool. Isn't that interesting? Or they all have the same number of sales people on their team. Isn't that interesting? I've done enough of these pitches now to know if you've got this, this, and this, this pitch is going to go good, and if you don't, it is not going to go good.
April Dunford :
So once you start feeling like I got the pattern here, it's starting to come into focus, then I think you're ready to really tighten things up, smash your foot on the gas and say, "We're just going to run at that because we know we can sell here. We know we win pretty much every time when we meet these conditions. Let's go do that."
Lenny :
I'm really glad we touched on this topic. I mentioned to you earlier that I was at a meetup last night and I was talking about this podcast that I'm starting and I asked who they'd love to hear on this podcast, and your name was the first name this guy brought up. And so-
April Dunford :
That's awesome.
Lenny :
... he's a huge fanboy. And I asked him what question he would ask you.
April Dunford :
I have fans. That's so cool.
Lenny :
You're out there. You're out there at meetups. And this is what he wanted to know actually is around just how do you think about this for startups and early stage stuff. So I'm glad we touched on it.
April Dunford :
Yeah.
Lenny :
The last topic I want to make sure we chat about, and this is what led to our conversation, we had a Twitter exchange about this was around segmentation versus personas and just how people confuse these things and how to think about these topics. And so I guess I'd love to get your take on just what's the difference between say segmentation and personas.
April Dunford :
Right. So you know how I said earlier marketers, we're really bad with definitions on things? And so everything in marketing is poorly defined and the marketers are always fighting over what do we mean when we say brand and things like this? So personas and segments, oh my gosh, terrible.
April Dunford :
So now this I think stems from if you go to marketing school, a lot of what you learn in marketing school is very consumer oriented, like consumer product oriented. And so if you're selling to consumers, a lot of the ways a consumer market gets segmented ... So segmentation is the way you split up a market.
April Dunford :
So the way you would segment a consumer market is you might say, "Well, I've got this toothpaste. And this toothpaste is for men under the age of 16 that want to get a date or something like that." And that would be how you would segment the market, which coincidentally sounds a lot like a persona.
April Dunford :
So personas are about people and it's characteristics of a particular buyer, a particular type of buyer. And so we'll do personas to try to get really deep understanding of, who is this buyer? What are they care about? What are their hopes and dreams? What makes them scared? What makes them excited? What are they trying to get done? This kind of stuff.
April Dunford :
Now we go to B2B and that's not how we segment a market. We're not talking about 25 year old down to the age of whatever, whatever. We're segmenting the market on different things. And in fact, in B2B, we can segment a market on almost anything, but typically there would be what we call firmographics, like how big's the company? How many employees? How much revenue? What geography is it in? But then we often do segmentations on things that are nothing to do with that.
April Dunford :
So if we really want to target a set of customers, often we'll say, "You know what? My product is really good for folks that have a creative team with more than three people and a budget of this and they use this particular software package." We win all day, if we have that.
April Dunford :
And that's a very actionable segmentation, I can go find companies that have that, I can make a list of companies that have that. And that's who my marketing and sales is going to go after. If sales needs to make a list of companies to go chase, that's that. And so in my mind, this is super important.
April Dunford :
Coming back to the previous question, when we were talking about, I'm starting to see the patterns in who loves my stuff and why, I'm not talking about the person there, I'm talking about the kind of company. What is common amongst the companies that love us, that I can segment the market and say, "Look, if your company is this size, you have this software package, you have this and this," I'm going to win all day.
April Dunford :
And so I need to understand that deeply in order to build my whole go-to market strategy, in order to have marketing campaigns that resonate with those kinds of companies, in order to make a list, if my sales are doing outbound, or if I'm doing target account selling, or ABM, how do I make that list of who I'm going after, that kind of stuff.
April Dunford :
Then we have personas. Now again, if I'm selling a consumer thing, maybe all I care about is personas, all I care about is who's this person who's the buyer. B2B, everything's a little bit more complicated than that. So in a typical B2B purchase process, particularly if it's what we would call enterprise software, even if it's not very expensive enterprise software, typically we have between five and seven people are involved in what we call making the decision for what gets bought.
April Dunford :
So if I come back to my example earlier where the VP sales decides they need a CRM and they pick on poor John, and then John's got to go figure it out. John, that persona, let's say he's the sales ops manager, we would make a sales ops manager persona that would capture that person, but there's other people involved in this deal.
April Dunford :
So as part of figuring out which CRM to buy, when he got in the later stages of the deal, he probably consults some of the sales reps, because they're going to be the end users of this thing, and so he doesn't want to pick something that they're all going to hate.
April Dunford :
He's probably got an IT department and IT probably gets to say about, well, does it meet our security and compliance stuff? And we're going to have to take care of it. Does it integrate with what we need to integrate with? Can it suck in data or push out data to our data warehouse or whatever? So that person has a say.
April Dunford :
There might be a purchasing department. There might be legal involved. There might be head of security involved. There might be chief security officers. Somebody gets their nose in there and gets involved in that. So five to seven people involved in this deal.
April Dunford :
And so here's where I think we go off the rails in marketing. So what I see marketing teams doing is they'll do personas for all those people. So they'll have this sheet and the sheet will say, Eric, the IT person doesn't like talking on the phone, who really likes video games. And they'll have this stereotype of Eric, the IT person. And then they'll say, Janet, the sales rep really outgoing, loves talking to people on the phone. Doesn't know what a video game is, that sort of thing.
April Dunford :
So for positioning work, I'm going to say something that is contentious, but I don't think it is at all. Think about how the deal gets done. Here's how this actually happens. Vice president says to John, "Go figure it out." John then does all this research and figures out how to get a short list.
April Dunford :
And then John might actually go all the way through to having calls with sales people and all this sort of stuff with all the vendors. And then John's really getting down to, okay, I'm going to pick this thing over this thing and then starts bringing in the other people.
April Dunford :
So by far the most important persona that matters is that one. We call this the champion in the account because this person, their job is to get consensus and champion the deal across everybody, including their boss, who's the actual economic buyer, the person that writes the check.
April Dunford :
And so if our positioning doesn't resonate for that champion, we're dead in the water. We don't even get on a short list. We don't even get to care about all the other personas, if we don't nail it with John because John's a gatekeeper.
April Dunford :
So my positioning needs to crush it with John. And at some point way down the road, I need to arm John to be able to sell IT, to be able to sell purchasing, to be able to make sure everybody is cool on the user side and to be able to sell their boss, who's the economic buyer.
April Dunford :
And so I think there's really only one persona that really, really matters in this, which is the champion in the account. And we should be very thoughtful and we should really have our arms around that persona. And then later in the deal cycle, we need to figure out how to arm that persona to go sell to all the other constituents in the deal. But if we don't nail that champion persona, we got nothing.
April Dunford :

**So I think it is an utter waste of time for marketing to build these stupid little one pager persona things for these 17 million personas and treat them like they're the same as the champion, when the champion matters times a thousand and all we really need to do is figure out how to arm the champion, because the champion's going to do this, the heavy lifting of selling IT. We're likely not even going to get all that involved. Gee, that's my [inaudible 00**:

Lenny :
That was amazing. I've never heard it described so directly and clearly. And so I think that's actually a good way to just wrap things up. I feel like I've sucked up enough of your time. Where can folks find your book, contact you if they want to work with you, anything like that?
April Dunford :
Sure. The book's called Obviously Awesome, and you can Google me and find that wherever books are sold. And then there's an audio book, if that's your jam or an E-book or whatever. And then my website is aprildunford.com, so you can find me there. I'm on LinkedIn, I'm on Twitter. I'm @aprildunford on social media, but I don't really do any social media except Twitter and a little bit of LinkedIn these days because I'm feeling less certain about the future of Twitter, but yeah.
Lenny :
Your tweets are great by the way. I highly recommend following April on Twitter.
April Dunford :
Oh good. Yeah, follow of me on Twitter.
Lenny :
How can listeners be useful to you?
April Dunford :
That's a great question. I don't know. Well, one thing I will say that I really love about Twitter is I use Twitter a lot to clarify my thinking on things. And so I really appreciate smart interactions with people on Twitter because sometimes I'll have a half-baked idea. And it's one of the things that I really like about Twitter versus LinkedIn, if I have a half-baked idea, I throw it out on LinkedIn and everyone goes, "That's great April," and that's it. Whereas if I have a half-baked idea and I throw it out on Twitter, people aren't shy about telling me I'm wrong.
April Dunford :
And I appreciate it because I think that's how your thinking gets clearer. I mean, I'd like you to be nice about it if possible, but I like it when people jump in and they go, "Well, actually that doesn't really work if it's this, this and this." And you're like, "Ooh yeah, actually, you're right. Never really thought about that before."
April Dunford :
So people that follow me on Twitter are really useful that way. And then I think I have this really engaged, thoughtful bunch of people following me on Twitter, people that are really interested in this stuff. And so I think it's kind of fun to be able to bat some deeper ideas around on stuff and not just have everybody go thumbs up, yay, April. That's kind of boring to me.
Lenny :
Radical candor, that's what you need.
April Dunford :
Oh yeah, I appreciate the thumbs up. Give me the thumbs up, but if that's all I was trying to do, then I wouldn't be throwing out as much half-baked, sort of controversial hot takes on Twitter as I do.
Lenny :
I use Twitter in a very similar way, and so I completely understand that aspect.
April Dunford :
Yeah, it's great for that.
Lenny :
It's amazing for that. April, thank you so much for making time. I learned a ton and I really appreciate your time.
April Dunford :
All right. Well, thanks so much for having me and congratulations on the new podcast. I'm so excited for it.
Lenny :
Me too. Me too. That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.
