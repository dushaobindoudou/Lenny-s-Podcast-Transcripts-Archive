## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### Say you join a company and you're like, "I'm going to do 30 days listening," and then your boss is like, "No, we need to ship stuff. Get on it, ship this stuff." Is there any advice for trying to push back on that, create space for listening when there's deadlines, things aren't [inaudible 00

53:56]?
Deb Liu :
I encourage everybody to get on the same page on this 30, 60, 90-day plan with their manager. So actually don't just keep it to yourself. Share it with as many people as you can. So I think it's very important that everyone sees what you're trying to accomplish and what your output is going to be. Because if you don't know the output, is success there? The second part is with your manager say, "Okay. I would like to carve 20% of my time listening and I'm happy to do this work 8...

### I'm listening to this book, or reading a book called Listen right now that a previous guest recommended. It's a parenting book and it's about just the power of listening and how much that solves many problems with your challenges or with your child. When your child is having a problem just listening to them. There's a lot of power. This came from a coach that was on the podcast recently. [inaudible 01

04:31]
Deb Liu :
Sounds great. I'll definitely, I'll read it or listen to it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I know it's weird. I'm like reading, it's called Listen. He's like, "This is the only parenting book you need really. It solves all the problems that we deal with." So anyway, that was an awesome final nugget that I'm glad we got there. With that though, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Deb Liu :
Let's do it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's do it. First question, what are two or...

**Say you join a company and you're like, "I'm going to do 30 days listening," and then your boss is like, "No, we need to ship stuff. Get on it, ship this stuff." Is there any advice for trying to push back on that, create space for listening when there's deadlines, things aren't [inaudible 00**:

53:56]?
Deb Liu :
I encourage everybody to get on the same page on this 30, 60, 90-day plan with their manager. So actually don't just keep it to yourself. Share it with as many people as you can. So I think it's very important that everyone sees what you're trying to accomplish and what your output is going to be. Because if you don't know the output, is success there? The second part is with your manager say, "Okay. I would like to carve 20% of my time listening and I'm happy to do this work 80% of the time." Therefore every morning from nine to 10, I want to talk to somebody in the organization.
:
Just make sure you say, "I will do a better job and have more impact if I have this time to make sure that I'm not accidentally making mistake or I don't get a chance, I'm asking something of somebody, but I've never met them." And to really carve out space because it's really important. Once you're in it, people give you the new person card for maybe a month or two and then suddenly it's all the problems are your problems.
:
But what if you don't know what the problems are? And so I always say diagnose before you treat. So make sure you understand so that you can help and deliver what your manager is actually expecting of you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm looking at your template. So just to share the bucket. So first 30 days learning focus, second 30 days is aligning on vision for the future, and the last 30 days of the 90 days is executing, setting up, actually starting to get stuff done. Awesome. Anything else along these lines of this?
Deb Liu :
The one thing about having a plan also is that you don't feel rushed to do something that you're not ready for because I do think sometimes you feel like you need to have impact. I always tell people, "Do something small, give back in some ways that people see you making." But when you actually reflect, one of the biggest things I could do was actually reflect back to the organization, "Here's what I heard from all of you. I'm listening, I hear this and here's what I want to do about it."
:
And then in aligning it's like, "Do we agree this is a set of problems we want to tackle?" And then an execution is like, "Do we agree that this is how we want to move forward?" And I think that is such an important part of building into a team. When you enter an organization, you're also entering a team and you're part of a dance that's going around. What role do you play? And people are dancing around you and if you actually make a mistake, you could trip other people up as well. So really finding your place in the dance is really important.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And as a PM, the way I always think about is people won't assume they should trust you. You're just this person that's coming in to tell them what to do and so much of your first month, two, three is building that trust with people so that they can actually feel comfortable listening to your guidance and not just like, "Oh my god. This person is getting in my way."
Deb Liu :
And earning that trust, sometimes people really... You'd be really surprised, a lot of people feel like they're not heard and even just coming in and listening is a trust building exercise.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Such a good point. As we wrap up our conversation, just a couple more questions here. So first is I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, which is a segment on this podcast. And my question is there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe? Something that you think is a contrarian perspective?
Deb Liu :
I don't know if this is a contrarian perspective, but I go to speak in a lot of universities. So I speak at Stanford and I'm going to speak at Duke. And I always tell people, especially young people, the most important career decision you make is who you marry. And it's not something we think that much about, especially I started dating... I met my husband when I was 18, my first weekend in college. Started dating when I was 19. We had no idea what our life was going to be like and yet every single day like this week we had our board meeting, I was in Utah the whole week. I come home and he's taking care of everything.
:
You will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang. If something is out of balance, it engulfs the other side. Both your job and your home life. And especially, we have three kids. Really balancing that is very hard over both of us having demanding careers. It's not something that's contrarian, but it's something which we don't think about at all when we make that decision. We think is this person fun to be with? Is this person somebody we see ourselves with? But my question is what is the impact of this relationship on your career?
:
Is this person lifting you up or pushing you back? Is this person someone who's going to be your greatest cheerleader or are they going to be the greatest weight on you? How do you think that that's going to manifest itself 20 years, 30 years from now? And I think it's just something I wish we thought about more and I encourage especially young people to think about that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Such a great point. What I want now is a guide for vetting these things when you're dating. Deb's guide to dating.
Deb Liu :
I need to write that. Although I've only really dated him, the one person, so maybe I am like the worst person to tell.
Lenny Rachitsky :
But it worked, so you're maybe the best person and now you look back.
Deb Liu :
That's right. That's right.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And here's the questions I asked that worked. That's so funny. Okay, so before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think might be helpful to share, something you might want to leave listeners with? Any other nuggets of wisdom or advice?
Deb Liu :
Well, there's one quote which I share, I thought about when you were speaking earlier, which is about people who are resilient, which is life... This is a quote from Chuck Swindoll, he's a Christian writer I used to read a lot and it was, "Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it." And I just looked him up recently and he actually published a book with that quote. He actually had that quote in a previous book from 20 years ago.
:
And I just think that's so important. You don't get to choose everything that happens in your life. So much is just, it just happens, but it's the people who choose a way forward to turn stumbling blocks and the stepping stones. As I said, "Somebody who actually says, 'you know what? I didn't get the job that I wanted and I'm just going to figure out another path,' those are the people who have the most successful and satisfying careers." They're thinking when other people are zagging vice versa. And I think that there are the ones who are the most resilient and happy in the long term.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's such a good circle back to one of your first pieces of advice of just most successful people are people that are resilient and don't avoid failure, but embrace it and find a way to turn that around. I think it's such an important point. It's so hard to do. I guess just, I don't know, just to follow this thread a little bit, is there anything that has helped you build that? Has that always been the way your mind worked? I imagine coaching helps this, helps people with this." Is there anything just like that?
Deb Liu :
Coaching is incredible for that. We joke it's work therapy, but really I think it's... For a long time I saw failure as this catastrophic thing. I was one of those kids who's like, "You never got a B until..." Then I got to college and I was like, "Wow, this is harder than I thought." And so I got two B's in college and I'm like, "I'm never doing that again." But I was that kid who always got the A, who got the great scores. I just thought that my life would end if I got a B which by the way is super unhealthy.
:
And looking back, I realized that work is not like that at all. And every time I got bad feedback I'm like, "This is catastrophic." But if you look at feedback as an opportunity, then it's very different. It's like this is a gift. I would be crushed. Every time I get a review no matter what rating I got, I would read the things that people would say and I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm a terrible person." And I had to really rethink that. And I think coaching, leadership coaching has really helped me through that to say, "No, how do you process this and how do you get to the other side?"
:
And that has been so transformative for me is to have that outlet to actually talk through. No, no, no. What they're saying is not that you're a bad product person, it's that you need to do a better job communicating or connecting. And I really struggled with that. I was very transactional. I was not a connector. I was not warm. I really struggled with relationships. And a lot of the feedback I received for many years is this relationship issue. And it took me a long time to realize that people aren't saying this because I'm a bad person or that they hate me, but because they want to connect.
:
I was actually making it hard. And I think sometimes we take things so personally that it becomes kind of this thing. It is your white whale. It's like the thing you're chasing, but then what if you say, "You know what, I don't need to do that. I don't need to chase that. Instead I need to figure out what's behind the feedback and what are they trying to say?" And then actually change yourself over a long period of time towards that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I had similar challenges where I had this pretty real imposter syndrome for a while when I started doing well. And a coach was the key for me to help me get over that and see that if I made a mistake. Things wouldn't crumble. And that it's very normal to make mistakes. Nobody will-
Deb Liu :
And by the way, I think perfectionism is a curse we place on ourselves. And it's a very dangerous thing, particularly for product leaders because product managers, you know things are going to go wrong. That's literally part of your job. And yet when we have perfectionism, it is a lack of trust in our ability to bounce back and our ability to actually adapt. But the more adaptable you are, the less you have to be perfect every single time.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just to leave people with a tactical piece of advice, say they are like, "Oh man, I need a coach," do you have any advice for how to find a coach? How to explore that route?
Deb Liu :
So I actually wrote an article, because one of the things I struggle with coaching is very expensive often, and not every company provides it. My husband actually works at a coaching company called Sounding Board to make it more accessible. But one of the things I encourage people to do is there are other ways to get coaches. I'm in a lean-in group and we are just like, we support each other. I'm in a coaching circle in YPO, so that's a group of CEOs. And I'm in a number of these coaching circles, which give you an opportunity to learn from each other and to get pure coaching. And I think that's a great place to start, especially early in your career when you're seeing the same people making the same mistakes.
:
I think as you get more senior, having an individual coach helps because the situations are so much more unique. But I do think that having that outlet, having a place to say, "Hey, is it me or is this situation not right? And how should I think through this?" That's so incredibly important.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**I'm listening to this book, or reading a book called Listen right now that a previous guest recommended. It's a parenting book and it's about just the power of listening and how much that solves many problems with your challenges or with your child. When your child is having a problem just listening to them. There's a lot of power. This came from a coach that was on the podcast recently. [inaudible 01**:

Sounds great. I'll definitely, I'll read it or listen to it.

I know it's weird. I'm like reading, it's called Listen. He's like, "This is the only parenting book you need really. It solves all the problems that we deal with." So anyway, that was an awesome final nugget that I'm glad we got there. With that though, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Deb Liu :
Let's do it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?
Deb Liu :

**So I love the book from Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer. I speak in his class now that I read it way before that, it's called Power**:

Who Has It and Why. I love the book. He actually has the more practical one, 7 Rules of Power, which came out more recently. And so it's a book that reminds us that power is not accidental, that people often get it for different reasons and how you should think about the playing field.
:
Another book is The Conversation, Dr. Livingston wrote that about race in America, and I just love that it's a very honest assessment of race in America. It's hard to have that conversation and I love that he uses a lot of facts and encourages people to open up and have conversations around it. And then the last one I would say is, well, Susan Cain's Quiet. I adore the book because I do have introverted kids. I myself am introverted and just to read the power of introverts as a reminder that we do have amazing people who don't communicate the same way.
:
I love that it's a tribute to the success of those. Even if our workplace is not adapted to it, I do think we need to adapt to it so that we can bring the best in everybody. But her book is a reminder that there's so much power even in silence.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The first book you mentioned Jeffrey Pfeffer, he's been on the podcast. I think he may have mentioned you in our conversation or-
Deb Liu :
I love Professor Pfeffer.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That was a fun conversation because I came into it very nervous for what his advice would be and then came up with it being like, "This is great. This is-"
Deb Liu :
He is very wise,
Lenny Rachitsky :
He's very wise and just very, "I don't care what you think, I'm just going to tell you the reality of the world." Oh man. Okay. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Deb Liu :
Okay. I know this is a fandom thing, but I love Fallout. So I played the game Fallout 4 last year, and then the show came out and it was amazing. And I know that sounds so nerdy, but it was incredible. And I know that video game movie annotations tend to be terrible, but it was so great and having played the game it was even better. Is that super nerdy?
Lenny Rachitsky :
No, I watched Fallout. I don't know anything about the game, but the show itself was really fun. Just I had no idea what I was even getting into. So no. Acceptable nerdy level. I don't know if you can get too nerdy on this show. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you just really like?
Deb Liu :
Well, so actually what's really interesting is I never got into Twitter. I just couldn't figure it out. Recently I really got into Threads and I didn't think I would. I was like, "Well, just post some stuff on it," but really I just love... I could never figure out Twitter. You follow the wrong person and the whole thing, it's terrible. If somebody is posting too much or too little, but there's something about the Threads algorithm that's really worked. The first few months wasn't quite there, but I just feel like it's spot on and now I see the magic of it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's so interesting. I've seen some stats that it's bigger than X now slash Twitter and I wonder if that's true. I got to look that up, but I've seen more activity on Threads. So maybe I need to go back there. I spent some time around-
Deb Liu :
Cheering from the sidelines that it's successful because I use it a lot now. And I guess I had never had a place for realtime news and it's not exactly meant to be newsy, but maybe it's just who I follow, but I love just seeing like, "Here's five headlines you probably missed." And I was like, "Oh." I know they're trying to downplay politics, but I just love that it feels like you get a glimpse of what's going on in the world in five minutes."
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family find useful in work or in life?
Deb Liu :
Ooh, that's a good question. Well, actually, I would say that it's very similar to the Chuck Swindoll one about life. So we can use that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Great. That's what I imagined because you shared that one early on. And I imagine that was going to be your answer. Final question, you started Facebook Marketplace, you built it. Now, it has a billion users, more than that. What's the most interesting thing that you have bought or sold on Facebook Marketplace?
Deb Liu :
The best thing I ever sold on there was I sold my minivan on it and in four days. I made my husband do it because I wanted him to test the product. We were selling our minivan and I'm like, "Just try Facebook Marketplace." He's like, "I don't know about this." And he's like, "There's too many people contacting me. I needed it to stop." So it worked really well for us. I think I have bought so many things on there. It's actually sort of embarrassing.
:
Recently, my daughter wanted the same desk as I had for her new room and they no longer sell it at Costco. And I found it for half the price from a woman who was moving and she's like, "Here," and I love it. So I bought probably way too many things on Facebook Marketplace actually. But it's a great thing. I actually use it as a great rental for kid stuff because you buy a kid's bike and then when they outgrow it, you sell it back.
:
And the rental fee is almost free and I don't have the store all of it. So I love every part of it. I still am an admin user and I send a lot of feedback back to that team still.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's amazing. Deb, this was amazing. I'm so happy we made time for this. Thank you so much for coming on. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe read about stuff you're doing? Where's your Substack and anything else people can check out?
Deb Liu :
Yeah, so debliu.substack if you want to look. I post probably about once a week. I'm on LinkedIn, I'm on Threads, so please do find me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And then the actual final question, how can listeners be useful to you?
Deb Liu :
Well, I would just love to hear what you heard from today that resonated with you and what you're going to do with it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And how would they share that LinkedIn or at Threads?
Deb Liu :
