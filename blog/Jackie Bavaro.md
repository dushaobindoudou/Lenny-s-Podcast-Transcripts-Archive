**I think the best way to learn and improve your strategy, one of them is going to be working with the other stakeholders and listening to their feedback and understanding what do they agree with or not agree with. Sometimes it's as easy as a conversation. I can't remember the details here, but there was one conversation on pricing models that we were talking about, and we were each going to go around the room and talk about which of the five pricing models did we think was best. And I think I was like, "Number three is most [inaudible 00**:

29:44] number two."
(29:44):
And then our CEO gets, and he's like, "I think really number four is the only reasonable one for these reasons." And I was just like, "I agree, I've changed a mind. You're right. You just saw it in a way that I hadn't seen."
(29:58):
This accumulation of experiences, I think matter so much for strategy, for data analysis, all of these things where... I'm really, really good at data analysis, but only because I've seen so many experiments that when I see a set of results, I can just instantly remember like four similar experiments and what the conclusion was and what went wrong with it. And so I'll be like, "Oh yes, this metric is up. But if you check this metric, you can see it's down, which means that it might be this conclusion." It's talking to people, listening to them, that builds it up a lot. But that's one half of it, because you can't always just learn something by a bunch of leaders sitting in a room talking to each other.
(30:37):
I think seeing things through to a certain amount of time really does help. And I think sticking with the team for long enough to be able to measure the results of what you did and ideally iterate, like being one doing it for eight years, I got to try something and then try something different and then try something different. And I got to really notice the patterns and test what works and what didn't and form those conclusions. I think that sticking around long enough to see your results and especially try something else different and see those results, I think can make a big difference.
Lenny (31:06):
What I'm hearing is you get better one doing it over and over and over to being in the conversations and learning from people directly. Is there anything else that someone that, I don't know, doesn't have a lot of these experiences yet and in the room for these sorts of things that they could maybe study up on or practice just outside of this to get a little bit stronger in strategy?
Jackie Bavaro (31:27):
Yeah. Definitely there's a lot of cross applying of strategy that I think that really is helpful. One of the great ways to learn strategy is to cross apply strategy from other places. One of the people I interviewed for my book was to Shishir Mehrotra, who's CEO of Coda, and he used to work at YouTube. And while he was at YouTube, he had a very big strategic question that the team had to decide about whether if you search for a video that is not on YouTube, but is somewhere else like Hulu, should you link them out to that?
(32:00):
And the team was having a lot of trouble making any progress on that. But one day he went to a product review for Google shopping, totally different product, shopping versus videos. But they were having a similar issue and they talked about this idea of consistency versus comprehensiveness.
(32:16):
They said "Is our product the kind of product where it's better to have consistent results all the time? Like every time you click on a result, it takes you to a Google shopping result or is it better to have comprehensiveness where even though the experience will be different each time we give you a result every time?" That framing, he was able to take from shopping over to YouTube and ask that same question and the answer didn't have to be the same, but it gave them a new way of looking at the strategy that he was able to use.
(32:40):
I think having that broad view and looking at lots of other products and seeing how they make their choices and how do they frame their decisions, that's a good way to improve strategy.
Lenny (32:49):
That's a really good reminder of eigenquestions as a framework. I think if you Google eingenquestions, you can find it and I'll try to link it to it in this podcast. And Shishir has a lot of great stuff that he's put out there. Good call out.
(33:01):
Let me ask one more quick question on strategy and then I want to move on to career stuff. How long should people, I guess, early PMs maybe, how much time should they spend on strategy development? And then, when does it make sense to start investing in that?
Jackie Bavaro (33:15):
Yeah. I think that for your first six months on a product, probably don't worry about strategy. For your six months really, you should be talking to customers, researching your product stuff. Really starting off by saying, "I'm going to learn the strategy, whatever strategy my company already has, and I'm going to do my research, but I'm going to deliver on that strategy."
(33:33):
But all this time, while you're doing your regular product work, so you're visiting customers and you're analyzing data and all these things, you are probably having ideas pop up in your mind. You're starting to notice trends. You're starting to notice what are the pain points people have and just stay open to that. And after about six months, I think is when you can start to put together a draft of a strategy for your own team.
(33:53):
I think you can take half a day. Just block it off, don't take any meetings, put on your headphones, go to a coffee shop, whatever it is you do to get your alone time. And just work on whichever of those three pillars of strategy, whether it's the vision, the strategic framework or the roadmap. Start with whichever one draws you the most and start writing some stuff down, just start getting your ideas out there.
(34:14):
And this will start to give you that framework, you can then go try to take that time, fill it out more, figure out what questions you have, what would you need to know to decide which of these approaches is better, what are the open questions you have. And then you can have something to start meeting with the rest of your product triad. The engineering lead, the design lead, any other key stakeholders you have on your team, and just start working with them and start to figure out how are we feeling about our strategy.
(34:39):
One thing I love to look for is repeated disagreements, "Are there any times when we're fighting over whether to add this feature? And I so strongly believe we shouldn't and you so strongly believe we should," and it's just ends up feeling like a battle of wills. Anytime you have these disagreements that feel really torny or they feel like a disagreement in values, that's a sign that really have a disagreement in strategy and that it's worth it to write down what your strategic framework is or what your strategic principle is and address the problem at that level, rather than fighting over individual features or individual decisions.
Lenny (35:11):
It's such a good tactical tip of just like, if there's continued disagreement, that's a sign, you either craft a strategy or maybe a principle which are related, but sometimes different, just principles of the product or principles of the team. Great advice. And the point you made about not spending the first six months on strategy, I love that because a lot of PMs come in are like, "Oh, strategy. I'm going to figure everything out. I'm going to tell us how to build this thing. This all sucks. Everything you all have done before." Just that rule of thumb, of not allowing yourself to invest deeply there for six months. Love that idea.
Jackie Bavaro (35:42):
Nice. Yeah. I think as a manager, you usually have a reason for hiring someone. And usually at least in your head, you think you've hired them to build on the strategy that you've already created, and there will be room for people to create new strategies and change the strategy. But if they come in on day one saying your strategy is all wrong, raises the question of, "Well then why did you join my team if you didn't believe in my strategy?"
Lenny (36:06):
A lot of times people just want you to help them execute. They're just like, "Come on. We know what we're doing. Just help us ship this thing and it's going to be great." And a lot of people come in like "No, let's just rethink it all. Let's take a step back."
(36:17):
Okay. Last area that I want to spend some time on is around career. Career growth as a product manager and product leader. Luckily you wrote a book called Cracking the PM Career. If you just had to boil down the best advice from the book to one suggestion to a PM, let's say starting off in their career and then maybe a mid-career, what would that be?
Jackie Bavaro (36:41):
I'll start with one piece of suggestion for people at any stage of their career, which is to have a conversation with your manager and say, "I would really like at some point in the future to grow into whatever this goal is," whether it's to become a people manager, become a senior PM, become a director, whatever this next step of what you want is. "I would really love to become a people manager someday. What do you suggest that I work on now so that I'll be ready when the opportunity comes up?"
(37:03):
The reason I love this template is just a really easy way to start off this conversation of saying "Here's my goal, by the way. I do want to get promoted, I do want to grow, I want to become a senior PM," whatever that next step is.
(37:14):
I'm framing it in the future so that it's not threatening. It's not like going to put my manager on the defensive and be like, "You're not ready to be a manager yet. I don't have to prove why you're not ready for that promotion yet." Which is not the mindset you want your manager in.
(37:26):
And then it brings them onto your side. "Can you help me out here? Let's you and me work together to get me this promotion. You and me work together to get me ready there." It brings them in onto your side, so now they'll be in the mindset of trying to help you. It will target the feedback that you get on what you need to do to get that promotion. Because so much of the time, I think the reason that success as a PM is hard is because you get a gazillion pieces of feedback.
(37:50):
They're all true. It's all like "Yeah. In that meeting, you said a lot of filler words." But that's not the thing that's actually holding you back from the next promotion, or it's not the thing that you actually need to improve at to get to that next step.
(38:01):
Being able to focus the feedback you get on what you're trying to achieve, makes a huge difference and will really help make sure that you get that feedback. And at any company, either your manager is going to be the person who decides if you get that promotion, what they say is just true, whatever they think you're missing is what you're missing, or there's going to be a committee. And if there's a committee, your manager's feedback matters a lot. And also if they've been at the company a while, they'll know what they look for.
(38:26):
If you have a new manager at a big company that uses promotion by committee, at any big company, make friends with your manager's peers, find someone who's been at the company a while, who's gotten someone to promoted and ask them that same question. Get them onto your side to get you the experience and the improvements you need to get that promotion.
Lenny (38:41):
Amazing advice. I found that to be super helpful myself. And you're saying that applies to every role. UPMs, everybody.
Jackie Bavaro (38:48):
Yeah. I think you can use that in almost any role because everybody does have different gaps, but then to go into early career people, I think that working at a large company early in your career can be just really, really valuable. If you choose a small company and what's going to be super successful and you pick the winner, that can be better than working at a big company. But big or, I'd say, even medium size companies can be really good here.
(39:10):
But a company where you're going to be able to learn best practices, you're going to be able to grow your network, I think that these large companies really give you... And you'll also be able to make usually a higher salary that starts to build your nest egg, I think that that gives you a really good foundation for anything else you want to do later in your career.
(39:27):
And when you're early in the career, really to have that mindset of absorbing and learning how to be a great PM. One mistake I see people make early in their career is they are trying to overdo it. They've been given some project, usually as a early career person, you get assigned a pretty narrow scoped constrained problem. They're like, "Hey, can you make the print dialogue for our product?" And the right answer to these narrowly scope defined products is not to invent a whole new print dialogue.
(39:56):
A lot of times you've been assigned a problem where a huge creative solution is a bad idea. If you're in one of the situations, just do the simple thing, get it done really well. And that'll earn you the trust to be able to take on bigger things in the future, but you don't need to be outstanding to make it past the APM promotions. You just need to be doing a solid, good job. And later in your career, there's a lot more room for being outstanding.
Lenny (40:20):
What are some of the most common mistakes that PMs make early on in their career that hurt their career?
Jackie Bavaro (40:25):
Yeah. A lot of it is misunderstanding what the role is at different stages in the career and misunderstanding what success looks like. This can show up in a lot of different ways. One of them is, there's lots of APMs who want to become people managers right away, and they poo poo all the regular everyday work you need to do to be a good PM. And that comes across to a manager as immature, certainly, but also just like you don't seem to understand or value what good PMing is, so I certainly wouldn't make you a manager. But also now it's a little hard to convince you to do your day to day job, which makes you a little hard to manage, which might mean put a little bit less of my energy into managing you. It ends up being a bad situation for people.
(41:08):
It's a lot better to show some enthusiasm for the job you're supposed to be doing right now. Other ways that can work is just people optimizing for the wrong things, like leaning in too much or too little. On PMs I see get paired with a really strong designer and you let your designer take the lead on everything. And now you just sit back and you're a note taker and you're not contributing anything. You're not really driving anything. You're not adding your own ideas and making the team better.
(41:31):
That person needs to step up more, to be somebody who's really contributing and adding and being a multiplier on the work of everybody else on their team. And then some people step too much. They're trying to lead everything and they're crowding people out and they're not giving their engineers a chance to present at all hands, and they're burning bridges with their coworkers. And almost every company peer reviews is a huge part of your review cycle. And as a product manager, you need to get along well with the other people in your team. You'll be pushing them and encouraging them to get more done than they would've otherwise, but you don't want to do this by having everybody say, "I never want to work with her again."
Lenny (42:06):
So much of advice I find for early careers, it's just like it should done, make impact, just your job, don't overthink it, if it won't earn your right to move up and take on more responsibility, get promoted on all kind of stuff. I love that so much. It's just do the work, just be quiet, do the work, it's going to go great.
(42:23):
A couple more questions. And before we get to a lightning round. You've exited the PM career path at this point, and I'm curious what made you decide to go in a different direction? And then just, what's next? what's next for Jackie Bavaro?
Jackie Bavaro (42:35):
Yeah. I'm not sure that I've exited the PM career path. I really like working in offices with people. I've been waiting for an end to the remote work era. And once I find companies that are in person again, I'm definitely have some curiosity about that. I might go back to in person work.
Lenny (42:51):
Oh my God. I'm imagining your LinkedIn is about exploding right now, as people are listening to this.
Jackie Bavaro (42:57):
I'm in San Francisco.
Lenny (42:59):
Oh boy. And then were you going to say something else?
Jackie Bavaro (43:02):
Nothing is settled, but I've been playing around with the idea about whether or not to update the Cracking the PM Interview book. Lots changed. Some of the companies there are not the top companies anymore. Some top companies aren't in there, some of the companies have changed their interview processes. I think that could be a lot of fun to get that more up to date. Some of the changes that have happened in interviews over the past years.
Lenny (43:21):
Amazing. I imagine many people will be very excited to see a second edition of Correcting the PM Interview. Okay. Let us get to our lightning round. Okay. I'm just going to ask six questions and just tell me whatever comes to mind as we go through them, real quick. And maybe we'll pull out a thread or two as we go through it. Are you ready?
Jackie Bavaro (43:39):
Yes.
Lenny (43:40):
Okay. What's a book that you recommend most to other product managers other than your book?
Jackie Bavaro (43:45):
I love Getting Things Done by David Allen.
Lenny (43:47):
Ooh, okay. Around productivity. I love that book. That was really transformative for me when I read it many years ago, and I still use a couple of this points. Awesome. Okay. Getting Things Done, David Allen. Other than Asana, what's a company that you recommend to PMs that are looking for a new gig? What are some companies that you're excited about, potentially?
Jackie Bavaro (44:06):
I'm not the most up to date with all of the companies, but I do think that Microsoft is pretty underrated. I had a lot of fun working at Microsoft. I learned a lot of good strategy there. I think I got a really good foundation for a lot of the rest of my career.
Lenny (44:19):
Contrarian pick and they've been killing it. That makes a lot of sense. Good choice. What's a favorite app right now for you?
Jackie Bavaro (44:25):
I have a recipe manager called Paprika. I really like it.
Lenny (44:30):
Ooh. Does it have actual recipes or is it track other recipes you've found?
Jackie Bavaro (44:34):
It tracks other recipes. You can save any URL and it'll extract the recipe from there and you can do meal planning in there. You can turn things into a shopping list. You can use it across your phone and your computer for when you want to sit down and browse. But I really enjoy just browsing recipes and a lot of them I'll never cook, but just the idea that, "Oh, I could imagine cooking that," it's a lot of fun. It's a little bit like traveling.
Lenny (44:58):
Wow. You could say Paprika. Okay. And then who's someone that you love to follow on Twitter or Instagram currently that maybe people haven't heard of? Or maybe they have.
Jackie Bavaro (45:06):
I love Helen Rosner, @hels, H-E-L-S. She's a food writer for the New Yorker, but it's a lot deeper than food. A lot of it gets into society and bigger topics.
Lenny (45:19):
Wow. I see a pattern here around food. Who's your favorite manager that you've had?
Jackie Bavaro (45:23):
I think it's probably JR at Asana who I worked for gazillion years.
Lenny (45:28):
Any particular reason why?
Jackie Bavaro (45:29):
I think there's got to be a match between you and your manager. And I think that we had a lot of mutual respect, and I think that I was really lucky in that he was absolutely amazing at vision. I was able to learn a lot from it from him. And there were a lot of places where I was able to help. A lot of my early experience of even getting to learn strategy and vision he was like, "Jackie, can you help me with the slides for the vision all hands?"
(45:54):
And I would be doing busy work of putting the slides together, but then I could make some suggestions, I could ask some questions. And first year I was just basically doing slides. Second year, I had a little bit of shaping. Third year, he let me take the first stab at it and then he reviewed it. I think he was always willing to help me grow and really saw it as a win-win where if I grew into something, then that would free up his time to take on something bigger and better.
Lenny (46:20):
Awesome. Sounds like an awesome manager. And then last but not least, what's a favorite interview question that you love to use?
Jackie Bavaro (46:26):
I love to ask, "Tell me about a recent project that you're proud of." I feel like a lot of interviews don't give people enough chance to shine, to talk about something that they did really, really well and hear about what made it so good and what are they proud of, and how did they achieve those amazing results.
Lenny (46:46):
And then what do you look for in an answer there? What are a couple bullet points of a good answer to that?
Jackie Bavaro (46:46):
It's so different for every question, but I'm definitely looking for try to get something recent, so I want them to be something that matches the level that they're applying for. There's going to be a really big difference between the way that an APM answers this question and the way that a director of PM answers the question. I look to see how did they think about strategy, what was their judgment on different choices, what was hard. I have a framework for this. The pearl framework for answering questions like this is problem, epiphany, action, result and learning.
(47:15):
It's a little bit like the star framework, but I want it all like, "What's the problem that you thought was worth solving, a problem that I think is big enough? What's your epiphany? What's the insight that you had? Do you notice something that nobody else did and how valuable was it?"
(47:28):
A lot of times that's what makes these PM stories so interesting. Is that meeting with customers, head on and they said one weird word and you dug into it and you learn this whole new customer need that no one else had seen before. And then there's going to be the action. Like "What did you actually do to make this happen? And was it hard?" Because usually it is hard, but understanding the ways in which it's hard and how you overcame each of those challenges. And then obviously a PM should care about results and the thing they pick that they're proud of should have good results or have at least results that they learned from.
(48:00):
And then, yeah, that last part of learning. "Did you grow from this?" Especially if it's a failure, which is lots of people love to talk about the products that failed or sometimes the interviewer asks them to talk about a product that fails, but I don't want them to leave it at "Yeah. It was a big loss. Our company lost $50 million and we couldn't get it back," but then you want to say like, "Okay, but what I learned from that is now I need to always run a load test on a staging server and then I've had many successful launches since then that we didn't have that same problem in."
Lenny (48:29):
Wow. What a fruitful lightning round. So many nuggets. We got a new framework in there too. Okay. Where can folks find you online and then any last words of wisdom?
Jackie Bavaro (48:38):
Yeah. I'm on Twitter, @jackiebo. I'm on Twitter all the time. Send me a message, I'll probably see it pretty fast.
Lenny (48:44):
Amazing. Thank you so much for being here, Jackie.
Jackie Bavaro (48:46):
Yeah. Thanks for having me. Great conversation.
Lenny (48:49):
