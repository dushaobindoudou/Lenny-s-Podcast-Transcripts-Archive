Archie Abrams :
Yeah, get it done.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's what I remember.
Archie Abrams :
So get shit done. And every project, so you got a core project, you have emergency service, you got growth project. And the expectation is that the group leads. Every single project that goes out has a few minute video with Figmas and everything, and everything that shipped. Needs to be okay-toed, so approved by the group lead. There's nothing that can ship without that okay-to approval. And that...

**GSD, yeah. [inaudible 00**:

52:10].
Archie Abrams :
Yeah, get it done.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's what I remember.
Archie Abrams :
So get shit done. And every project, so you got a core project, you have emergency service, you got growth project. And the expectation is that the group leads. Every single project that goes out has a few minute video with Figmas and everything, and everything that shipped. Needs to be okay-toed, so approved by the group lead. There's nothing that can ship without that okay-to approval. And that okay-to approval has to be Glen, Carl, myself with different groups. And so that is how everything is reviewed. Now of course there's great amazing teams that do amazing work, but it is that that's how the system works.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And okay-to specifically means someone above reviews it or all this whole team, everyone looks at it?
Archie Abrams :
No. So Glen reviews the core stuff. Carl reviews the MS. Okay-to. It's interesting.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's basically Glen is founder mode and not as a founder where he's involved in all the details, has final say. So this is a really cool example of founder mode, but not as a founder.
Archie Abrams :
Correct.
Lenny Rachitsky :
In the way you guys operate. And I imagine sometimes Tobi disagrees with Glen and then they talk about it and things get ironed out.
Archie Abrams :
Totally. And that's why we come together every six weeks, everyone in person to review every project so we can hash out those disagreements. Go through all the core projects, all the merge service projects, all the growth projects. And it's a great forum to say, "Hey, here's where we disagree," really on the how and the tactics of what's happening. And we can flag those things, have good debates about whether there might be misalignment.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. What a unique way of working. I'm so fascinated by all this. So what I'm hearing essentially within Core, Glen and his team come up with, "Here's what we're going to build the next quarter." You guys have twice a year releases, is that right? Or is it every season?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah, so big additions. Twice a year. Obviously continually shipping, but we package them twice a year in a big bang.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Big launch. Yep, I've seen those. Okay. So he's like, "Here's what we're going to do in the next release. We're just going to build this because we think this is right. And we're not driving a specific goal. We're building for 100 years in the future. Let's just build it." And basically you build it. He's like, "This is great, not great, iterate until it's this good," and then ship. And great. Okay, this is great. Okay, so then there's that team, and then there's your team, which is drive some freaking numbers, drive growth, hit these goals. How do you collaborate across these two teams? Do you have a model for how you work together? Because these feel like very different ways of working?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah, honestly, it's been one of the things I'm very proud of. We built a really great partnership for the last three and a half years, because it's intentionally meant to be almost at odds, and that's part of the structure of how we want to work.
:
But it comes from, I think, a place of respect on both sides. And I'd say for anyone, it's okay, here's what growth is going to do. We're going to do it in a way that is high quality, that is shipping really good stuff for merchants. We're probably going to approach it in a faster way. We might disagree on things, but we're going to have reasonable paths to handle that conflict.
:
And so while there's no magic bullet, it wasn't like these are the surfaces that growth can touch, these are not. It was like you can go anywhere in the product, but let's go figure out how to work together to figure out that quality bar to understand when you're going to be different on it, on the quality bar to get something out to learn, and just building trust along the way that we're actually going to ship high quality things and we ship it to 100% and move. And so a lot of great work on the team to make those relationships really strong.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Got it. So basically, you guys are like, "Moving this button over here is going to drive so much growth," and then Glen's like, "No, this is not acceptable. We don't want a button here. This looks terrible. Everyone's going to hate it." So that's the healthy tension. I'm describing a combative-
Archie Abrams :

**[inaudible 00**:

56:01] totally. And it's like, okay, so how are we going to work to figure this out? It might be, "Hey, we're going to move the button. Hey let's run the test," but see the short-term lift. You know we're going to monitor it long term. You know when we ship it, it's going to be high quality, high quality polish. And you trust us to make those trade-offs.
:
I wish I had a better answer of it's very human. It's very that trust that's that's very important in any of these. I think growth with other teams is like, there's no replacement for just the human trust and then following through on commitments of no, we are actually going to make this thing really good.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Is there an example of that, that comes to mind where you had something that was you thought was going to drive meaningful growth? You showed it to Glenn, he is like, "No, don't know about this." And then either you iterated or you just forget it, this isn't right for the platform even though it's going to drive some meaningful growth?
Archie Abrams :
The place that we often come back to is, and this is with I think Tobi is great, Tobi and Glen, is on wizards. So wizards-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Onboarding carousels.
Archie Abrams :
Onboarding carousels. Some way that basically has folks get set up by not using the actual product. And so we've always kind of danced around and we have very specific no wizard principle, but I think that sometimes the tension is wizards can serve a purpose in certain circumstances, but we've avoided doing that. But we've always worked to try to make the principles of what a wizard does really well, which is it simplifies the product into something that allows people to have a lower bar, to try to work with core to bring that into the actual experience itself.
:
So the example of that experiment I mentioned to you of giving pre-filled sections in the online store editor, you could have solved that in a wizardy way of, "Enter a few things, and we're going to generate these sections for you." Instead, we actually took those pre-generated things based on what we know about you and put it into the actual project experience itself.
:
So it tried to get at some of the principles of what a wizard can do well without avoiding the wizard principle, without creating actual wizard. So that's been some of the, how do we work together to get the intent of what the growth ideas but in a way that's consistent with the way we want to build in core?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Got it. And I get why that you think about this a lot because you talked about one of the biggest levers is onboarding and helping more people get activated, and so I could see why you spent a lot of time thinking about how do we help more people succeed there.
Archie Abrams :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I want to ask your insight on this idea that people might be listening to this and feeling like, "Oh, we need to build a team that just builds great product and is not constrained by metrics and driving growth." Short-term thinking, long-term thinking, 100 years. This is inspiring I think to a lot of companies because the sounds great.
:
What do you think it takes to make something like that work? Because in a bad case, this team just sits around and builds whatever they want, and the rest of the company's like, "God damn, this sucks. I have to show success in metrics and moving a metric in this team, over there just build beautiful things." Is it like you need a founder like Tobi, that prioritizes this and values it and has a very good taste and intuition? What do you think are important elements of something like that, of this approach working at a company based on what you've seen?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah, I think it needs to have a very opinionated founder set of people who are driving what good looks like. And I think Shopify a few years ago and before maybe sometimes drifted into the mode of, "We are just going to build stuff and each kind of team is just going to build stuff not really accountable for it," and that is a very, very bad state to end up. So I think you either have to use, my sense is metrics as accountability, which is the most common kind of way to drive accountability and focus. Or extremely strong founder or set of folks who have extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is. If you have one of those two, you can make it work, but the worst case is let's just go build a bunch of cool stuff in kind of a haphazard way. That I don't think would work.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, this is great. So either you need metrics to tell you you're doing the right thing or really correct and good taste in your founder.
Archie Abrams :
Correct.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Cool. I think that's a really good way of... And I imagine every founder is going to think, "Oh, that's me. I have this, I can do this." I think it's rare in real life. It's rare that you're like a Tobi, or Brian Chesky, or Elon.
Archie Abrams :
100%.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. It's hard to internalize that, but I think that's the reality. So most people will be more successful building things that are driving metrics they can track in an experiment.
Archie Abrams :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. This is very fascinating. I'm so happy we're spending so much time on this. Okay, there's a few other random things I'm going to touch on. One is sales. So historically, Shopify has been very product-like growth, very organic. Go check it out, sign up, shop a store, start a store, grow. And you guys have layered on sales. In a sales motion that's an increasing part of your business. What have you learned about your team, the growth team working with sales and making that a successful relationship?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah, no, it has been great over the last couple of years as built out, the sales order has added a whole new kind of motion to Shopify. As Shopify's product got better, it can serve the biggest companies in the world. It's like the natural evolution. Well what are you going to do that for people to grow up on Shopify and to be the biggest companies, but we're also going to take folks another platform, bring them over.
:
For growth in sales, I think the biggest learning from the the R&D side at least has been the scale is very different with sales, and so it's really hard to use as much quantitative data to make growth, to make some of those decisions.
:
And so a lot of it has been building much more qualitative insights working with merchant success, sales about the challenges they're facing and onboarding a large customer. So how do we build import tools that work for them? How do we make sure they have the right guidance in the product for a very different set of use cases? So a lot of it has just been very much empathy building with sales about what that merchant journey looks like, and quite frankly challenging ourselves to think differently. It's been one thing.
:
And then second, we kind of built two very distinct funnels for a little bit. There's a sales funnel. You come in, you contact us, that's it. There's no mention of self-service, there's no this. There's just drive MQLs, boom. Then there's the self-service thing. There's no mention of sales anywhere.
:
So one of the last thing the year, last year we've been really doing is how do we create these hyper journeys where there is... We shouldn't force the merchant to choose, do you want to talk to sales? You want to do self-service? Should give them the options, whatever path that they want to go on.
:
And so a lot of that has been building into the self-service journey over to sales and then from sales into self-service. That's broken a lot of metrics in the business. That's broken a lot of ways people have thought about their jobs, and so there's been a lot of cultural resetting and just getting smarter from a metric standpoint about, how do we measure this thing of hybrid journey? They came in via self-service, they went over to sales. How do we value each of those components in the process? And transparently, that's something we're still getting better at, but it's really important to get there.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Is there an example of something that broke that would be illustrative of what you're describing?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah. So I think that breaks is drive someone from an ad over to self-service. We typically look at only the self-service LTV of that person. But what happens if they come in, they sign up via self-service and then they go talk to sales? They get changed to a sales driven merchant, which means that that value of that merchant, which is usually actually quite large, does not get associated back to that ad campaign. Oh, guess what that means? That means you would probably reduce investment on that ad campaign because you weren't valuing that. Our system had two different models for calculating LTV. Sales driven one, and a self-service one. Uh oh, we're going to make suboptimal investment decisions now by kind of moving things around even though it's the right thing to do.
:
So a lot of it's in rebuilding all instrumentation, how we do LTV modeling, how we do attribution, how we do incrementality testing across each of those different types of outcomes, because it was not an intuitive thing for us originally because we had built all of these systems with a much more siloed view.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, basically attribution gets a lot more complicated. Are you going in a multi-touch attribution direction or is there something even more clever?
Archie Abrams :
My rant is I am... Multi-touch attribution as its place. I think ideally what we want to get through is what we really care about is incrementality. So incrementality is kind of the gold standards, for people who are less like attribution measure is, how do you assign value to a given touch point, right? Click, a view, etc. But it doesn't tell you causally what drove something. That's where incrementality tells you. Incrementality test is basically don't show ads on meta for certain number of people. Show it to the other set, see what the lift is and the outcome.
:
A lot of what we're doing is trying to get a lot, is continuing to get even more sophisticated in incrementality measurement for not just self-serve outcomes, but for self-service outcomes that then drive to sales for sales specific outcomes. And as soon as we have that kind of incrementality at the channel level, we can get a lot more sophisticated in terms of our bidding, budgeting, and all of that. But that's really the key thing we want to get to.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There's certain topics that alone can be their own podcast conversation to just dive deep into this stuff. But I'm going to stop myself and I'll go further down that track. Let me touch on a couple more things before I let you go.
:
One is marketing. So we talked about sales, marketing. You guys don't have a CMO, there's no Shopify CMO. Instead you embed marketing leads within the org. For folks that are trying to grapple with that, should we hire CMO? Should we do something else? What have you learned about maybe the benefits and also maybe some downsides of approaching it the way you guys have approached it?
Archie Abrams :
The benefit is, so there's growth marketing who sits in growth, there's revenue marketing who sits over closer to sales. There's a brand team under Harley who does amazing work. Our president. There's marketing embedded in core and PMM, sit with the product managers there. There's shop marketing on a consumer side. So marketing is truly everywhere in the org.
:
And I think the benefit of it is it's closest to the primary goal that those marketers are trying to do. They sit with growth so we can focus on that self-service motion. Harley is an amazing communicator, so brand sits with him so he can have a lot of influence over that. And so I think it sits with the people its most relevant outcomes are driving, which is great. It allows us move faster with less kind of coordination.
:
I think it only works because Tobi and Harley has such amazing intuition on what the brand is, needs to be, and all of that. Some of what the CMO does of kind of creating the cohesive story of Shopify it held in their heads and they have the pen on that.
:
And so that allows then, that piece of that CMO's job to not be as important at Shopify. But the other pieces are obviously critical, but they can be now closer to the action and where they're going to drive the most impact. The downside is things are sometimes very messy. So that's...
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's another example where the founder, their background and interest in skills can impact significantly the way the work is structured and who you hire and don't hire. Okay, one last question. Totally different topic, discounting. So you worked at Udemy for a long time. And from what I understand, discounting was one of the key reasons Udemy succeeded and one of the big differentiators. I'm curious what you learned about discounting, the power of discounting as a growth lever.
Archie Abrams :
Yeah, so Udemy is a very an online marketplace for online courses. So come on course. And I think what was happening in I started, and we were there 2012-ish was people were like, "What is this online course thing? I don't really understand what it is. I don't understand what the value is and what I'm willing to pay."
:
And so what discounting has a really powerful effect on is it can signal value with a high list price, but then bring something down to an affordable price. And that may seem like of course that's obvious, but in online courses what was important is the list price would be high at 100 bucks. So it's associated with a college course. But what people really value this thing as was a book.
:
And so you could signal very high, signal quality through price, which was very murky at that point in online learning. Signal value through price. Discount it to 10 bucks, or that was a typical Udemy deal. And then so 99% off, 90% off. We might see fire sales, but it changed the value in willingness to pay and then it tapped into the fact that, and still is education is very aspirational.
:
And so what a lot of people missed in education is yes, we want people to actually take the course, but that's actually in many cases not the job to be done. That there's an emotional job that's even more important, which is I'm feeling like I'm making progress in my educational journey, and just the act of purchasing a course or the act of buying a book is progress.
:
And so if you can make it very enticing, very high value thing, cheap, urgency, you can let people make that emotional journey by the act of purchasing, which then allowed us to actually have very good retention. Because you could keep coming back to that emotional job over and over again, which just counting with urgency allowed us to do.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Well with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Archie, are you ready?
Archie Abrams :
I'm ready.
Lenny Rachitsky :
First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?
Archie Abrams :
So one, I love to go back to marketers who wrote in the 1920s. And so one that I love is Scientific Advertising by Claude Hopkins. So it's basically one of the first direct marketers that came out and he innovated on some of the concepts of copywriting and just how you sell a product around can't make this product, can't sell the product, can you tell the product will help the customer achieve their goals? And so it's really fun. I find it really fun to go back in time, because there's a lot of really good first principles thinking that I think we've actually lost in more modern stuff where it's like personalization band, it's optimization, all this stuff. Where it's like how do you actually write and sell things really effectively? Scientific Advertising, it's a great book.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's just like the name alone, it sounds really cool. Especially for someone in your shoes that feels like the perfect book for your role. And I think there's so much wisdom in just the thing someone figured out many years ago about what convinces people to buy something is still true and people overcomplicate it. Just going back to the original is often really useful.
Archie Abrams :
Totally. And The Perfect Mile about the chase for sub four minute mile by Roger Bannister and a few other folks is just a wonderful... As a runner, it's a really fun book to read about perseverance, how these folks really, they all competed to get to that really amazing goal of under four minutes in a mile.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
Archie Abrams :
I went back in time and I watched for the first time actually the entire season or all the episodes of The Sopranos, which was quite fun. Highly recommend. I did that in The Wire in the last six months.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's a lot of watching.
Archie Abrams :
It's a lot watching. Work out in the morning on my elliptical or bike, so it's a nice-
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's smart-
Archie Abrams :
Workout show.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's a good motivator to just work out out something. I got to watch the next episode. The Wire, it's hour long episodes and five seasons times 20. I think it's 22 episodes per season, right?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh geez. It's a lot of watching and I did that once and I was like, "I've got a lot of episodes to watch," but incredible. Okay. It's funny you should say The Sopranos. I feel like a number of people recently told me they're watching the full Sopranos again. It's like a trend recently for some reason.
Archie Abrams :
Oh, interesting.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Anyway, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?
Archie Abrams :
So the AI music creator. My kids and I... I'm the least musical person in the world and it's been amazing. My kids and I will create songs together about our days, about what's going on. So it's just been really fun to be able to have a musical experience for a non-musical person, and have that creative experience for them and it's been really awesome to use.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Suno is Insane. I think it's Suno.ai, folks want to check it out. It's just such a fun party trick too, just to write a song on the spot about something that you're thinking about. Awesome. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find helpful and worker life?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah, I often come back to the plan is the plan until it's not. And it's basically like we have a plan. It's the plan, it's our best, let's commit to it. But acknowledge it might change and we'll deal with it then. But if the combination of we have a plan, stay focused on that, with also the acknowledgement that you need to be flexible, and try to combine those two sometimes contradictory things of focus plan with we got to be able to react in an effective way.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Reminds me of strong opinions loosely held as a concept.
Archie Abrams :
Totally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Okay, final question. So I asked your wife what to ask you when you came on this podcast and she suggested that I ask you about your late father who had a lot of impact on your leadership style. So here's my question, what did you learn from your dad that impacts the way you work today?
Archie Abrams :
Yeah. My dad a lot is a father, and he was an entrepreneur in technology. And I think one of the things that I so appreciate about his leadership style was the empathy, and curiosity, and kindness that he showed in everything. And I hope in some of the stories that of him, it's like no matter who anyone was, curious, love to engage and learn from. And I hope that's something that I try to take inspiration from is just be with everyone kind and learn from everyone you're with and around. So something I think about a lot.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That super resonates. He sounds like a wonderful human as are you. Archie, this was wonderful. We touched on so much. We covered so much. I feel like we could go on for many more hours. Maybe we'll do round two as you learn more things at your time at Shopify. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to potentially reach out or follow the stuff you're up to, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Archie Abrams :
So not super on social media. But on LinkedIn, check me out, send me a message. And then yeah, if folks are hiring a bunch of folks, growth marketers, PMs, engineers, data folks, UXers, you want to work at Shopify and growth or other parts? Fully remote. So we'd love to have great people join.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**Awesome. And that last point, I think I'll just highlight one of the few remaining fully remote tech companies that is not returning to work. Returning to the office [inaudible 01**:

17:05] work. Definitely work.
Archie Abrams :
Yes. Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. And sounds like basically you're hiring across all functions.
Archie Abrams :
All functions.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Perfect. Archie, thank you so much for being here.
Archie Abrams :
Thank you Lenny, it was fun.
Lenny Rachitsky :
