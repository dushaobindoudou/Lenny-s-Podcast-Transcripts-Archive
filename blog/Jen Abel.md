## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### This was me helping [inaudible 01

00:15].
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh man. Okay. Anything else in that step that might be helpful to folks?
Jen Abel :
Yes. One thing to caveat is you do not get paid until you are approved by finance, and procurement has a signature on the contract. Meaning don't start any work. Or if you do start work, know that there is no payment. The business unit can't just pay you. It's paid through a purchase order, which is paid through by finance.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So don't rely on that money unless it's finall...

**For product market fit timeline [inaudible 00**:

20:51].
Jen Abel :
Product market fit. Yeah, that amazing image that I think has been reshared more times than anything I've ever seen. It's interesting because if you look at, I was looking at this closely the other day. If you look at the top section where the time to product market fit is consolidated, and you go all the way down to the air tables and the figmas, which a long time to get to product market fit. If you think about the earlier ones, which were, it was like GitHub that had product market fit pretty quickly. The SOC 2 compliant company.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Vanta.
Jen Abel :
Vanta. There's this thing in my head and I haven't fully validated it but I'm going to share it with you, which is did they start with the market problem first and then build the product? Because they knew who their market was right off the bat. Versus an air table and a figma that I think started with a technical insight and then were trying to find their market.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think that's absolutely right. Vanta, the way they approached it, Christina, she was searching for a pain. She was obsessed with talking to everybody about a pain that they needed solved, and then she just built it in spreadsheets. So she started with the market very much so.
Jen Abel :
And I think product market fit when you start with the market first, it's accelerated. But I will say this, I think that it's also capped on the upside. Because you're starting with the market versus the air table and the figma, which started with the technical insight and has uncapped upside. But one is certainly riskier than the other. Starting with a product is a hell of a lot riskier. And this is where I come back to so many people will say, how did you get funding and not know who your market is? And it's like, because if they do find it, that's a really, really, really big win. Versus I think if you start with the market first, you could potentially get a good win but is it more capped?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Interesting.
Jen Abel :
I don't know, it's just a thought. I was staring at your grid for so long, I was like, there's something here. And I kept coming back to those were more like I kept breaking it down to market versus product.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, I love this. I think there's definitely something there. There's also horizontal versus a very specific problem you're solving.
Jen Abel :
Totally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, so you mentioned clay and you kind of nerd sniped me there of just what tools do you find useful? And it makes me think about finding leads, which is kind of going backwards through the sales process, but it might be okay, so maybe let's spend time there. Just like what do you recommend to founders to find the good leads? Glengarry Glen Ross good leads.
Jen Abel :
So I say before you buy any tool, don't even think about tools. I feel like people turn everything into this complicated mess with all of the tools that they start integrating. And then they're engineers, I get it. So now they start to engineer these sales tools together and then they blast their market, and now they have 5,000 notes out in one day and their domain takes a hit. So I think before you even overthink about the tools right now, can you manually find 30 people that you want to spend 15 to 20 minutes writing a rock solid note to? Are there 30 people that you are deeply excited to learn from, that you are willing to invest 15 to 20 minutes to write a really thoughtful note? Let's just start there. So some questions. One, are they even discoverable? How hard is it to find 30 people?
:
What have you noticed across those 30 people? Are there any interesting insights? Maybe it's the size of the team they work on, maybe it's the industry they're in, maybe it's the length of time they've been in their role, maybe it's their previous roles in their career. Are there some commonalities? There's always some level of a commonality usually in most cases. Okay, so now you're starting to collect some parameters. Just by doing this exercise, you're starting to collect some parameters around who you want to learn from and sell to. Now if you send out those 30 notes and you wrote them specifically, and you spend good quality of time on it. And you've hit them on email, you've hit them on LinkedIn, maybe even tried to call them, maybe you've sent them a Twitter DM, pulled out all the stops. How many people respond? 1, 5, 0?
:
If it's zero, it begs the question, do you now want to do another 30 in a very similar fashion? Do you want to change the messaging a little bit? Now it forces these natural experiments. Or do you want to maybe go after a different role? So it forces you to answer these questions in a very manual way before you even think about integrating and spending time on tools. And then you get to a point where it's like, okay, now I'm starting to get some learnings and now I've realized, okay, it's this group of people, I've spoken to maybe two or three, now I want to go out and actually build a campaign to now talk to the next 10 to 15 people in that group. Truncate this as much as you can because I think people focus so much on volume in the beginning.
:
Even if you're selling down market, mid market, enterprise, volume comes once you've identified it and know the parameters. Parameters then allow you to do really strong enrichment with a clay. You now know the types of questions to give it. If you're not asking it the right questions, these enrichment tools, these sales tools will yield nothing. So it all comes back to even before you start your sales call, you need to make sure you're asking the right questions with am I even engaging, or do the people that I want to learn from or sell to, am I even messaging them in the right way? Are they even the right person? And the only way you can do that is by actually truncating these little experiments.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love how tactical that is. And what I love is even one of your nuances you mentioned is can you even find them? This gives you a signal of how are... You're going to have to have hundreds of these, thousands of these eventually. If 30 is hard or impossible, you're in trouble already.
Jen Abel :
Totally. And it was funny, I was talking to someone today that said they had a target segment of high net worth individuals that they wanted to go out and serve. I'm like, how do you find those people? I guess when you get to a certain level, your net worth may be public. I don't know. That stuff's very hard to have certain parameters that are undiscoverable. And then if they're undiscoverable and it requires you getting on a call to understand if they are a fit, that does impact conversion rates. Not necessarily in a bad way, but now you need to kind of bring that back into the math equation, which is like, okay, if I speak to 10 people, I know two out of these 10 will be qualified. But I don't know which of those two out of 10. Well, that means you probably need more of those numbers.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So to quickly recap a few of the key things that I've written down as we're talking. So if you're just trying to figure out who to reach out to, make a list of 30 potential prospects that you think are good fits, that would be excited about what you're building. Spend 15 to 30 minutes writing them each an email. Do these emails have to be really short the way you described previously?
Jen Abel :
I would say the shorter the better, but would you respond to that? If you got this email, would you respond it?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Got it.
Jen Abel :
One of a great little tactical test is on Gmail, you can highlight the message and then have it replay it back to you from an audio perspective.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh wow.
Jen Abel :
You'd be shocked how many notes I've changed when it replays it back and I'm like, oh, that sounds really passive-aggressive.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Interesting. And so you also shared the structure for how to reach out to folks. So let me just share that again. And that applies to this initial email too, but it sounds like as you automate, you want to make it more precise and focused and not... Basically they're not as customized as you start reaching out to more folks.
Jen Abel :
Totally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So start with something, here's why this is relevant to you. You're looking for salespeople in this market. Here's something that's unexpected or surprised, like zero to one salespeople don't exist. Keep it short and then I always forget the last one.
Jen Abel :
Focus on the problem.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Focus on the problem.
Jen Abel :
You don't even need to talk about the solution. That's the big takeaway, which is if you get any sales email, you get what's the primary focus of that email? It's usually like here's what we do. But I bet if someone reached out to you with a novel insight and said, I'm really passionate about solving this problem, if it's something you're focused on, you'd probably reply.
Lenny Rachitsky :
If it's a big problem. If it's like, oh yeah, you're so right, I need this.
Jen Abel :
The beauty with the American market, and I say this because we do a little bit of work with international startups too, is if something doesn't feel right, people love to complain about it. And it's like use that to your advantage. Get that intel.
Lenny Rachitsky :
A note that I just looked at, that I wrote down, that I think is very important is avoid using "this is better" as your pitch.
Jen Abel :
Yeah, yep.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Different. Here's something shocking about what we're doing. Here's something that'll surprise you.
Jen Abel :
Yeah, or counterintuitive. Exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Counterintuitive.
Jen Abel :
Yeah, it's interesting. I spoke to a good friend that leads procurement at a massive organization. And he said to me, he goes, "One of the worst things someone can say to me is we're better than X product. Then I ask them to define that. And then I ask them, okay, how do we measure that? And then I say, okay, should we give this company another year to give them this feedback before we make this huge transition and disrupt momentum?" Yeah, better is a dangerous place.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I invest in a bunch of startups and I find it's impossible to get anyone to care if things are good enough with what they got today. I'm happy not using the best possible product if my life is okay. And I have so many other things I got to do, I'll just deal with this good enough solution for now.
Jen Abel :
Absolutely.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, amazing. So we talked about how to figure out who to go after, how to pitch them to get them to want to talk. The next step I imagine is you're on the phone with them trying to convince them to actually care. What do you do there? How do you get them to engage further?
Jen Abel :
One is you need to be vulnerable. You're an early stage startup, okay. The market, we're at a point now where the market is smart. I always assume that the buyer I'm speaking to is highly educated and knows way more than I do. So just have that perception because what I've learned is a lot of the market will play dumb, and you can get yourself caught pretty quickly. So when you speak to them, I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We are deeply passionate about solving this specific problem. We have a lot to learn. Here's how we are thinking about it from a problem priority perspective. Can we gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side? And then let them open up. Now you have them one, talking about the problem. Now you're getting the intel about their perception of the problem, and is it even a problem? When you say you're early stage and there's still a lot to be done, it is easier to be honest.
:
If you tell them you have a fully baked, ready to go product, they're not going to give you honest feedback. It's very hard to say to a founder and look them in the eyes and say, hey, we built this product, can I show you what it is? You're just going to get someone that's going to say, oh, this is great, this is wonderful. But when you're vulnerable and when you tell them it's not fully built yet, even if it is, you will get more raw and honest feedback. Because it is easier to tell someone, hey, before you make this mistake, I actually don't care about that. If you've already built it, they're not going to give you that feedback. So the further you suggest you are, you're actually going to hamstring a lot of the intel, hamstring yourself on gaining a lot of the intel. So that's one counterintuitive thing that I think a lot of founders don't realize.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Our native integrations on your product roadmap, whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your user's other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today. But building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering according to the 2024 state of integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Copy AI, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon, so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The results, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations.

So I had April Dunford on the podcast a while ago. I don't know if-
Jen Abel :
She's awesome.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. And her last book, it actually has the opposite advice, but I think I know why, which is she focuses on later stage companies and her advice is the buyer. She has this really interesting insight that it's harder to buy software now than to sell it, because there's so much to consider and your job is on the line if you make a mistake. It's easier just to be like, forget it, I'm just going to go with what we have today. I don't want to put my ass on the line for buying this new thing that someone's trying. And so her advice is you actually have to educate the buyer on the market and here's what's happening. Here's where things are going, and here's why I think this is the future. But I think again, I think that's focusing on later stage stuff.
Jen Abel :
A hundred percent. And you raised such a good point, Lenny, which is late stage sales and early stage sales are very, very different. And I think that's where a lot of early stage founders get tripped up as they're taking late stage sales advice, usually coming from an investor. Or they've maybe hired a salesperson that's focused on more mature sales. But I think she's spot on. Buying is just as hard, if not harder, than selling right now. Because who wants to make a mistake and also who wants to go through switching costs? Oh, it's so painful.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. I think the other really important point here that you're making is that part of this initial sales experience of founder led sales is not sell as much as you can. It's to learn what people want. And so I love that you're sharing here's how to get the best possible feedback, not necessarily close the most deals.
Jen Abel :
Totally. And founder led sales is not about revenue on day one. It is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse, so that you can earn the right to sell. There's this concept that I talk about, which is you're going out to run sales to collect the research, which is what founder led sales is. And then you have sales for revenue, which is that post founder led sales stage.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And your milestone that you suggested of how far to take founder led sales, you said around a million ARR, right?
Jen Abel :
Yeah. I think it's about, some people say 500, some people say a million. I think if you get to 500K really, really fast, then I think absolutely you can move out of it. If you get to 500K really, really, really slow, you might not want to get out of it right away. You haven't reached that velocity point yet.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. I have a post that we'll link to that has actually numbers and when all these big startups move from founder led sales. It's in that same series about product market fit. There's two stories this makes me think of I'll share real quick. One is Sprig. They shared a story of first round capital at their first round and their partner there is just like, we will not let you hire a salesperson until you hit a million ARR. We're going to help you. We're going to have salespeople helping you through it, but we're not going to let you hire someone. And he was really happy about that. The other is Zip, which just raised a $2.3 billion valuation, a procurement company that I was lucky to be an investor in. And their first founder led sales motion was they just reached out on LinkedIn to heads of procurement, and just leaned into what you're saving more, which is we just want your advice on this product that we're building. Just tell us what problems you have. It was very advice oriented versus we want to sell you this thing.
Jen Abel :
Yeah, no, absolutely. I have this theory that maybe you shouldn't hire any salespeople until series A, right? Because seed is all about experimentation and proving out that experiment, and then obviously series A is about exploiting that learning. But I see so many people, I mean hiring for early stage sales is the odds are actually more against you than trying to get your next round of funding. Because it's truly, truly such a counterintuitive stage.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Interesting. Okay, so I kind of took us on a whole tangent. You were sharing advice on how to get someone excited. So the first is when you're engaging, you're talking to the prospect and company ABC. Your advice is be very honest and vulnerable about your stage. Tell them you're early stage. You're building this thing. You're deeply passionate about this problem. Here's what we're trying to do, here's our priority problem perspective, and where we're focusing, and kind of get their feedback on your approach. Cool. You were going to go to the next tip and I took us off course.
Jen Abel :
Testing the questions to ask. Where is that aha unlock for you? But more importantly, where's that aha moment unlocked for them? Because when they start getting their gears churning in their head about, and this is the beauty about not having a product and not showing them anything, they're visualizing in their head now. This is a really powerful thing, which is like, so tell me how this looks in your head? How are you seeing this? And they're like, I don't know if I can see it. And I'm like, great, we'll show you that. Great insight to know by the way. Or so I think this is how, I guess this is how it would work. Walk me through what's living in your head right now. You pick up on so much and then all of a sudden they're like, wait a second, we've tried solving for this and it's still not solved for. Or you know what? We hired someone last year to manage this. Great understanding. Is it being measured? Is it being managed and have they tried to solve for it? The leading indicators that you're onto something here.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love this thread because this is what everyone's always like, how do I know if I product market fit? There's these signals that you're talking about of signs that there's something here. Like a big enough pain point where they're excited to basically they want to pay for it, they will pay to solve a problem. So maybe just again, say the things you notice that are signs like, okay, you have something here.
Jen Abel :
So I think the first is it has to be a growing and widening problem. No one's going to spend time fixing a pretty fixed problem, because it's not necessarily really a priority anymore. It's maybe a pain in the butt, but it's not a priority if it's not growing or widening. So gate check one is like, what is the implication? Are you measuring? Are you managing this problem today? Yes or no? If they don't know, great to know. If they said no, okay, move on to the next. That's pretty powerful. No, we're not measuring or managing this. Okay, there's probably not much there. If it is being measured or managed, then the next question you want to get into is how have you tried to solve for it? Is it through that head count that you just hired? Is it through another tool? Is it just still an open gap because nothing exists yet to solve it? Just understand their maturity around how they've tried to plug it. These are all that make the secret moments in intel to close that gap.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's awesome. And essentially it's showing you that there's a pain here that they're paying attention to and are trying to solve.
Jen Abel :
And what you're psychologically doing is now you're flipping them into a buyer where they're like, wait a second, hold on. I need to bring on so-and-so on the next call, they also think that this is not good enough.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's funny because that's exactly what Wiz noticed, is they moved from people being like, oh, this is cool. I like it, I like it. To, okay, I'm going to pull in this person. I'm going to pull in this person to talk about it and make sure we're... And they were pulling in other people exactly as you described it, because they wanted to move forward on this thing.
Jen Abel :
Absolutely. And that's when you know there's some momentum behind it, which is when they're bringing in other colleagues. Whether it be the potential users, if you're reaching out to the executive, or the users like, hey, I actually want to bring my boss on to the next call.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Good sign. Cool. Anything else along these lines of how to get someone excited slash understand if there's going to be pull there?
Jen Abel :
I guess the one thing is please, please, please do not ask questions like what keeps you up at night? If you had a magic wand, what are your pain points today? I can guarantee you that answer changes every single day.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's super interesting. Is there any tip for how to end one of these calls, as someone that's never done sales is like-
Jen Abel :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay.
Jen Abel :
Get the second call booked on the first call.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Love it.
Jen Abel :
Pull up calendars. Look at calendars. Who else should be invited? It's just a natural evolution to ending the call.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Great. So that's in 30 minutes though, right?
Jen Abel :
And if they say, ah, I'll email you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I could say.
Jen Abel :
That's also kind of a leading indicator. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So do you recommend not getting off the call, trying to avoid that, or is it just-
Jen Abel :
If they won't give you time on the calendar, you could say, listen, great. Feel free to email me. Maybe they're just being honest and they don't have their calendar available, but nine times out of 10, it's usually I don't have the heart to tell you I'm not interested.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to tell people you're not interested. Very cool. Okay. This is amazing. Okay, so the next step, if I remember correctly, is kind of co-authoring and co...
Jen Abel :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, cool. Talk about that.
Jen Abel :
In the early, early days, one of the biggest ways you can get folks excited is it feels like it's going to be built specifically for them. The power of specificity, the power of being extremely focused. With that, you can literally turn a customer into a guide by asking them to co-author the scope. The scope of work. The co-authorship piece is important for two reasons. It helps you understand where they're on their biomaturity. Let me explain. If they do not have an existing process or strategy to solve X problem, they can't buy a technology yet, which means you need to sell them. And this is why I go back to you need to sell them some form of a service, right? Why? You want to be the one in there educating. You also want to get the logo. You also want to show the revenue. While it's not recurring revenue, it still shows intent.
:
And I think that that's really important. Every founder I speak to is like, well, my investor really doesn't want service-based revenue. That's fine. But then you can also tell your investor, great, should I wait 18 months to when they're ready to buy a solution, and be the one that's not the one selling them because someone else educated them? These are all of the implications of waiting. So yes, is service-based revenue great? No, we all know why it's not great. But it's great in the sense that it shows intent. It's great in the sense that you can call them a customer. It's great in the sense that now you can use their logo. And it's great in the sense because you are getting paid to educate them. You are getting paid to help them design their process. This is where all the power lives. And this is why so many AI startups a year and two years ago were going in on services contracts, because they wanted to set the mindset with the buyer around what this would look like.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Is there anything you recommend to time box contain the services piece? Because I know a lot of companies-
Jen Abel :
Yes, such a great point, Lenny. You absolutely need to time box this. I would time box it as 90 days and then what you can say in the next 90 days, we'll scope where we are and what you need. Scoping out more than 90 days, listen, so much is going to change. You might also not want to do it anymore, so you don't want to lock yourself up. So I would look at 90 day increments. A specific example. We had a founder that my colleague was working with, and they were selling a very specific technology to a non-traditional... Sorry, a very traditional industry. I don't want to be two bleeding with what it is, but a very traditional industry that's not used to working with startups, or necessarily plugging in a new technology right away. And they were very honest. They said, listen, we haven't changed vendors or partners in over five or six years.
:
I actually don't even know how we would do that today. Could you come in and explain to us, understanding where our workflow is and how we would integrate this, before we even consider the technology? Which we did. We got paid a nominal amount, but we're now a customer and now we get to set the stage for how they think about this. And then they won the technology contract. But everyone is so focused on selling the technology really, really, really quickly. That works in markets that know how to buy that technology, have a process in place, have a strategy in place, have an implementation team in place.
:
If it's a new technology like AI right now, they need a strategy and process like who's the human in the loop? Is it them or is it you? How do we measure success? What does success look like? What risks should we be aware of? Our legal team's not even aware of all these risks. You want to be careful because legal can immediately, and procurement, can shut these things down if it seems too novel, where it's foreign versus they're so used to buying services, especially at market. It's their largest budget line item.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So it's interesting because most founders are very afraid of moving into services. I hadn't heard this advice before.
Jen Abel :
Probably going to get slapped for saying all this stuff, by the way.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Well, so along those lines, what percentage of companies that you've worked with or see do that or have to do that step?
Jen Abel :
This is going to be a shocking step. So I would 40 to 50% have to sell some form of service before they can sell a technology.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. Of B2B SaaS company?
Jen Abel :
A B2B SaaS. And this, again, this is specifically more top-down sales. But yeah, because the user and the buyer are different, which means there's user value, there's buyer value, there's all different players, there's procurement you have to go through. But yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And just to make it even clearer, what's an example of a service that you've seen company offer in a step?
Jen Abel :
So I've seen, hey, can you come in and actually help me pitch this, design a custom pitch to my boss as to why we should do this today? And we literally got paid to build a sales pitch.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So it's not necessarily providing a service. It could be just helping them sell this.
Jen Abel :
Yeah. It could be helping them sell in a way that makes you... You need to get a lot more context on their business. It can also be, hey, we haven't actually thought about a process for how we can actually deploy something like this. We're currently using this technology, which we want to change from. You've kind of hit this at the right time. How would we implement or how is it best to integrate with this tool? Can we get both of you guys in a room to map this out?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Got it. So it's like consultants almost, like coming in to help you solve this problem.
Jen Abel :
It's a great point. It's consulting them towards the acquisition of the product. It's not consulting as one-off consulting.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Got it. And they know that obviously you're biased, but they also want the problem solved. And they're like, great, you're going to help us solve this problem, because it's on my plate and I need your help convincing leadership that this is-
Jen Abel :
And I need to craft the storyline as to why we need to do it anyway, so I will pay you to do it, but here's the format it needs to be in.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Fascinating. Wow. Okay. Anything else along those lines?
Jen Abel :
And then of course, if you're in a position to actually sell the technology, because the market is able to acquire and adopt it and not have to create a new strategy or process, then obviously sell the technology. You don't need to be selling services.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I want to come back real quick. The previous call, I wrote this note down as you were talking. You recommended not doing a demo and just talking about it broadly.
Jen Abel :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Is that your advice there?
Jen Abel :
On the first call. Yeah. On the first call, my fundamental belief is that the demo is a bit of the only carry you control in the sales process, right? Once they see it, it's kind of like pitching an investor. Once they take a look under the hood, that dreaminess in their eyes, they're like, oh, I saw it. So leave them wanting more. And the demo is that, leave them wanting more. Even when you do a demo, don't demo everything. Leave it for a second call. Let them invest a lot of time in you. Again, if it's qualified. Preface that, if it's qualified. But everyone races through the sales process like let's do a demo call as quickly as humanly possible.
:
Yes, that is important down market. That is important if you're selling a $3,000 tool, you absolutely want to be demoing as fast as humanly possible because it's a high-volume game. Upmarket, when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, you want to slow that down as fast as possible. Because you want to, one, make sure all of the right people are in the room. As soon as there's one lead on this, and if it requires other people involved, it doesn't feel like anyone else's baby. So you want it to make it feel like the group's baby versus this one individual's baby because it's very quick. Someone can easily say, I'd rather use this tool. And then there's this stalemate of nothing happens.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just to maybe reiterate, so far we've talked about figure out who to talk to, pitching them on talking to you, then having that first conversation. Maybe there's another conversation in there to get them excited. And then there's just getting them past the finish line, keeping everyone aligned. Is that roughly the next step or how should we think about this?
Jen Abel :
Yeah, so if you are selling upmarket and you now need to go to procurement, who is the group involved in the bot. They're the professional buyers. Procurement is a very interesting function. They are very smart, very, very smart. They do this for a living. They are professional buyers. So there's a couple things that you need to be aware of. You need to sell them as well. You need to really make this sound... Don't over complicate it. Don't add in jargon. Make it feel like, okay, I can wrap my head around this. The second piece is it's got to feel different from anything else out there. Because the professional buyer, it's much easier to say, wait a second, we have these 17 other preferred vendors that do similar ish work. Why don't you just go use one of them? Because, oh, by the time this gets through procurement, it could be another three to four months.
:
I've seen deals die on the vine because procurement actually suggested they go use another vendor in the system, that this buyer wasn't even aware of, because they didn't differentiate. It didn't feel different. It just felt slightly better. That's how it was positioned. The third piece is when you get to procurement, you're going to have to do all the work. Make their job easy. You are probably a very small piece into the very large deals that a lot of these people buy. So you can get easily sidelined just because you're just a small buy. So do the work for them. Literally say, I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Give me the forms that you need to fill out. I'll fill them out for you, and you can do it yourself. You can edit them. Do the lift for them. If you don't, it's so easy for it to just go there and die.
:
Another piece that's important with procurement is explaining exactly what you do and don't do. Because if you say you do a bunch of things and they can't really place you, they're going to send you to the kitchen sink of contracting an MSA, which is going to ask you for $5 million in an insurance policy and all sorts of other things. And the ability to look at your book at any point in time. And the reason they did that is because they can't classify you. So the easiest thing to do is classify you as high risk. So make it easy for them, make it simplified. You can also truncate your contracts, meaning let's say IT is maybe, and you want to ask this, how long does it take to get through IT due diligence? They might say, oh, it's a 90-day backup, it's a 60-day backup, it's a 30-day backup.
:
There's no backup. If there's a backup, you also don't want it to die and you want it to give an incentive. So this is when you want to truncate contracts to a technology contract and a service contract. Service contract allows you to onboard them, get them prepped, come in and educate all of the users about what they're about to go through. So that then there's an incentive to get that technology piece through. There's all these little things to think about, and I think everyone... Getting to procurement is also creative. And knowing who you're dealing with and how to make their job as easy as humanly possible. Because what you said and what April said is spot on, which is buying is just as hard as selling.
Lenny Rachitsky :
As I'm hearing you describe this, I feel like we might be discouraging people from selling because this feels very not fun. All these steps, all these procurement work, anything you can say to get people to feel like, okay, this is worth it?
Jen Abel :
Yes, I can get people very excited by this. Once you are in, you are in. Once you are in, you are now a preferred vendor. You now have the ability to cross over into other business units. You are now the reason that, hey, if your competitor comes in, well, you got there first. So what do you think procurement's going to say? This is why it's so important to get into the enterprise as fast as humanly possible. While it's a headache to get through, if you project manage it, you'll be good. If you make an accountability, just like if you were to go through fundraising. If you are a part of a team that had to raise money, it's no different. There's always some level of due diligence. There's always you doing more of the work than them. That's just enterprise sales. But if you prove value, your hundred thousand dollars deal could be $500,000 next year. Your $500,000 deal could be a million dollars the following year.
:
This is where stuff begins to compound, and this is where your growth journey really gets accelerated. So the beauty with enterprise is once you're in, you're in. You beat out your competitor for a short period of time. There is a little bit of a moat there, but it's not forever. You all have intel that no one else will have. Meaning you're a part of the conversations, you have the badge, you can join the meetings, you can ask for introductions. They'll do it. It doesn't feel like sales anymore. You're now a partner. This is why it's so powerful to get into the enterprise because there's so many compounding effects. If you put the effort in on the sales side, the return is insane.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That was awesome. Nailed it. I'm excited. Just for folks that are listening, just to calibrate what size of company you're talking about selling to here, what's the size of the advice you've been sharing so far? Roughly?
Jen Abel :
So I've been talking a lot about enterprise sales, which is I would say anywhere north of 500 to a thousand employees. Just mental model. I'm talking about enterprise sales specifically because there's so much nuance involved in it, because the user and the buyer are very different, right? As you go down market, let's talk about small business for a second. The user and the buyer are the same person. There's no procurement. If they like what you've built, it's pretty straightforward process. In the mid-market, mid-market is a funky place because you either are anchoring towards the lower end of mid-market, which is more upper end of small business, or you're anchoring towards lower end enterprise. Those are two very different divides. So mid-market, just if you're talking about lower end enterprise, again, this is all relative. If you're talking about lower end small business, again, your user and the buyer probably are the same person, which makes sales a lot more streamlined.
:
But churn. Small business, challenge with small business is the churn. If they get pissed off, if they don't feel like it's good enough, they are gone faster than you don't even realize. And they might even tell you. They'll just cancel. And we always see this on Twitter. They'll call American Express and say, cancel these charges. I don't want to talk to these people anymore. They're just more irrational because sometimes maybe it's their money if they're a small business. So small business in mid-market, while sales is a bit faster, you really got to be on the product market fit side, worried about churn.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And they also go out of business at a higher rate.
Jen Abel :
Exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And so you have that kind of churn.
Jen Abel :
A churn piece too. Yeah, exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Okay. What comes next? So we're kind of in procurement at this point.
Jen Abel :
Okay, so now we're at signature, right?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay.
Jen Abel :
Okay. So as you enter procurement, okay, you want to know before you get to the next stage, who is signing this deal? Here are some examples of signers I've seen. Chief financial officer, chief legal officer, the business unit head themselves, the head of procurement. You want to know who that person is so that you can literally say to the head of procurement, hey, listen, I want to make sure this person has everything they need when they review this, to know what they're signing. Who is it and how can I give you a few bullets to share that you can maybe respond to, that we get tight so that they know exactly what they're looking at?
:
This was two or three years ago, I was involved in getting a deal over procurement that was just truly, it was a pharmaceutical company and it was very, very long process. And we got to the finish line and the CFO was the signature. And this is when I made the mistake. CFO responds back to the procurement lead who sent it to the business unit, who sent it to me and was like, what am I signing? I don't actually understand what these people are doing and why are we doing this?
:
So then she quickly said to me, hey, listen, we need to defend this. Can you put together some bullets? And I'm like, well, what kind of bullets do I need? What does this person care about? And again, it created so much anxiety and now I'm back in the bottom of the queue. Probably he or she's looking at the things that come in in an order of priority. So now I've elongated this by another month simply because I didn't plan. So this is just to say I'm learning from my own mistake of know who the signature is, because if they don't know what they're looking at, they're going to kick it out and you're going to lose your queue spot.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So many ways to fail. And this was you selling Jellyfish or this was you working with a company?
Jen Abel :

**This was me helping [inaudible 01**:

00:15].
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh man. Okay. Anything else in that step that might be helpful to folks?
Jen Abel :
Yes. One thing to caveat is you do not get paid until you are approved by finance, and procurement has a signature on the contract. Meaning don't start any work. Or if you do start work, know that there is no payment. The business unit can't just pay you. It's paid through a purchase order, which is paid through by finance.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So don't rely on that money unless it's finally, unless the signature's on the paper. Quick tangent, thoughts on discounting at any parts of the journey?
Jen Abel :
If there is a reason as to why. So discounting just to get the deal over the line, you're negotiating with yourself. Unless they ask for it and then ask them to defend it. Certain segments, like small business, you should leave a little bit of room for buffer because sometimes that's their own money. It's like their own small business. Mid-market and enterprise, there's got to be a reason why and ask them. Be like, hey, so if I give you a 30% discount, can I remove 30% of the value? You can kind of play it a little bit like that. I don't recommend it, but that's kind of what they're saying. But discounting is great if they're doing something for you far and beyond. For example, if they're a design partner, if they're going to be a reference for two years, if they're going to give you something far beyond just using the technology, then yeah, I think a discount is a good reason to give back to somebody that's giving to you, but not as a strategy to get a deal done.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. Is there anything beyond this step of getting the signature? Are we done?
Jen Abel :
Yeah. I hope you celebrate because-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, great. You got a signature from this whole process.
Jen Abel :
Yeah. Hopefully I'm not making this sound too daunting. I'm just really trying to lay out all the mistakes I've made.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, no, this is exactly what people need. This is amazing. And your pep talk was really helpful too. Along the way. What's the general timeline for sales process like this in your experience, with these 500 plus ice companies?
Jen Abel :
So there's three things that dictate sales cycle. One is how well are you project managing it? For example, I'll say, let's have our second or third call in two weeks. Two weeks? Do a week. Why are you elongating this? Keep your calls as tight as possible because that shortens your sales cycle. The second is just how complex the organization is. If you're dealing with a highly regulated industry, just know it's going to take a bit longer, sometimes 20 to 30% longer. So a highly regulated industry, nine to 12 months on conservative, on the conservative side. Again, it's tricky because is there a budget line item dictated towards it yet, or are you creating budget? How painful is the problem? And how senior have you gone? If you're talking to the SVP or chief of whatever, they're pretty good at about being able to navigate the traps.
:
If you're dealing with a director or mid-level person, they maybe have not purchased something before and just make some internal mistakes. I always say it can range anywhere. I've seen enterprise deals close in 90 days, believe it or not. Rare, but I've seen it. I've also seen enterprise deals typically take anywhere between six and 12 months. Really important but. Enterprises know that the process and the length to get the deal done is what costs more than the technology itself. Meaning the effort it takes to get through their system. That's why they're willing to spend so much. Sometimes that's actually more expensive than the technology itself. So don't negotiate with yourself, understand the value you're delivering, but don't be crazy. I've seen people try and go in with a million dollar deal as a seed stage startup. Oh, interesting thing. So interesting tactic. I've seen contracts in the enterprise that state that the deal cannot exceed more than 20% of the existing revenue.
:
So there are these things just to be aware of. In most cases, you can ask them be like, is that a hard line? Is that hard, hard line? Or how negotiable is that? Sometimes it's negotiable. Sometimes it's like, no, this is a hard rule. But then it seems silly because you take a hundred thousand dollar deal and bring it down to 20,000. It's just be careful that you're stripping some of the value out. But I kid you not. I've seen an enterprise deal go from, it lands at 60 and it turns into 280,000 in four months. So again, I want to encourage, yes, this is a lot of work, but the payoff is exponential.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What's a good ACV to start with if you're trying to sell to enterprise, to make it all worth it for your startup?
Jen Abel :
I would say anywhere between 50 to 200K depending on the business unit you're selling to. That's kind of like sweet spot. They're used to something in that realm.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**And this is a startup selling [inaudible 01**:

05:38].
Jen Abel :
Early stage startup, like founder led, early stage.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Initial contract. Wow.
Jen Abel :
Yep. Initial contract. I would say, okay, probably caters more towards like 50 to 100K. But I've seen people sell to... Again, it's how big is the problem? Who are you selling it to? Is it the SVP that you started with and they've got a large budget, and it's a pretty healthy business unit? Or are you selling to a director?
Lenny Rachitsky :
If you're not able to sell your product at that price? What's your advice to teams?
Jen Abel :
If you are a startup, I always ask the founder, did you build this for the enterprise and is that the model you want to play? Or did you build this for small business? Small business is a marketing game. Marketing intensive activity, right? It's high velocity, high volume, lots of dials. It's a very different game than enterprise. So which game do you want to play? Let's just start there. Which game is more attractive to the founder. Or who is more exciting to serve? What's the storyline you want to tell investors? That plays a lot of it into it too. And do you have an enterprise product? Are you solving an enterprise problem or do you think you're solving an enterprise problem but you're not sure yet?
Lenny Rachitsky :
And your point is also mid-market is it's rarely to be successful.
Jen Abel :
It's hard to start there because you're straddling two very different go-to-markets, right? One that's of high value, one that's of high volume. And also mid-market companies, this is where a lot of people don't... If it requires heavy integration, they don't have those resources. That's usually outsourced to an Accenture or some of these consulting firms, and now you're having to rely on third parties to be involved. It gets messy.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This is fascinating. I have a list of questions from the audience that you pulled from Twitter. You asked on Twitter what questions to ask you as you're coming on here. So there's one that's very related to this, which is someone said, if you're still very early in pre-product market fit, but get initial validation from both small to medium businesses and enterprise, how do you decide which one to focus on? Is there a counter argument against starting or SMB going up market over time like most companies do?
Jen Abel :
I've seen companies successfully do in both of those motions. Truthfully. We know all of those. We know people that started small business and worked their way up into enterprise and were successful. We've seen people be really successful by starting at the enterprise, like a Wiz. That's more of an internal question, which is like, who did you build this for? Where's the problem most felt and which go-to-market game do you want to play?
Lenny Rachitsky :
And I think that latter part is so important. It sounds like why should it be what I want? It's like what's going to make a big business? But I think people forget, this is going to be your life for 10 years. Do you want to be selling to enterprises and building all the enterprise features? Would you prefer to build for small companies? Pros and cons to both but it's important to think about the life you're creating for yourself and your team.
Jen Abel :
A hundred percent. And I built my career in enterprise sales, upper-end mid-market enterprise sales, and yeah, that's just the game I know the best.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, that's also an important part of it. Just to double down on that is like what do you have experience doing? Not like...
Jen Abel :
Exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. Where's the opportunity? Okay. Another question that I love is, and we touched on this initially, but I think it's good to come back to this. Someone said, customers are fascinated with what we're offering from the initial calls, but responsive momentum is too slow from their end. Would be great to know how to fix this.
Jen Abel :
Yeah, it's tough because unless you're in the weeds to understand why. I'll give you a few examples that it could be. Did you speak to a buyer who now is trying to sell this up to their boss, and it's just getting sidelined and they don't know the executive value? They've just been selling the buyer value the whole time. That's one reason things can slow down. Another reason things can slow down is you haven't really framed the problem well and they don't understand the full implications of why they need to solve it. So it's kind of just sitting there a little bit. The third is they've just been really nice and it's not going to go anywhere.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I guess that that's usually the latter. Was that true or it's kind of all over the place?
Jen Abel :
It's so hard to give a founder hard feedback. Because they've just dedicated their life to this thing. Who wants to be the bearer of bad news? And sometimes you just need to let the actions speak louder than words.
Lenny Rachitsky :
We've talked about all these steps. I'm curious, when you come to a founder or your team, where do you find the most on lock often? Which of the steps of the sales process do you find the biggest opportunity to improve conversion in sales?
Jen Abel :
It's qualification. Qualification because if you spend your time on the wrong leads, that equates to a zero. So if you don't get that first level right, let me put it this way, everyone that I know says they have a bottom of funnel problem. It's never a bottom of funnel problem. It's a top of funnel problem. I've actually never seen a bottom of funnel sales problem. It's always qualification, which is a symptom of not reaching out to the right person, not having the right messaging, not solving the right problem, or not being different enough.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love this. So basically the biggest pitfall people fall into, in your experience, is they're just talking to the wrong people, wasting their time?
Jen Abel :
Yeah. Talking to the wrong people or using the wrong message or...
Lenny Rachitsky :
Pitching them something they can't actually deliver.
Jen Abel :
Yeah. Here's the other thing too. Sales is supposed to feel fun for the buyer. They should be like, this feels fun. This person's invigorating. They're going to change my world. They're going to make me see things differently. They're going to get me promoted. They're going to help me increase my influence internally. And so many salespeople are so boring. How many times have you got off a call and you're like, I can't wait to get off this call? And founders too, just like all of a sudden their passion, they go like stone cold face. And it's like bring the passion. Bring the energy. That is felt by the market. Remember, some of these people are in boring jobs. Give them an outlet.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So along those lines, I think a lot of people are just not... Like me included. I feel weird doing sales. It's a weird experience trying to convince someone to buy something. Is there any advice you could share to get someone over that hump?
Jen Abel :
If you have built something that you believe in. Very hard to sell something you don't believe in. I think everyone agrees that. If you've built something you believe in and they have a problem, that's a beautiful thing. Truthfully, that's what makes the world go around, is I have a solution to your problem. Now you just need make sure that the problem, you just need to be honest, that the problem they have, your solution truly can solve for. And you're not short selling just to get a logo and a deal over the line, and see them churn in six months or nine months or three months. That what you are selling is truly going to solve their problem. And be honest about it. I can't tell you enough when I tell someone, listen, I don't think I'm the right fit for you. They try and sell you on them.
:
They're like, well, wait a second. Hold on. What if we did this, this, and this? And it's like, no, no, no. Here's what we're great at. And then they can say, well, I also need that too. And all of a sudden, this level of trust comes out. And trust is the number one currency in sales. If you are a trusted salesperson, people will recommend you all day and every day. If you're a trusted founder, your market will continually send you leads and word of mouth. So don't try and sell something just to prove to investors you sold something, because it'll be quickly seen on the other side when they churn.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Okay, Jen, so I'm going to cut the lightning round. I know you also have to run and do real work. So let me give you a chance just to talk about what you do, how you help companies in case folks can find value in working with you.
Jen Abel :
Deeply passionate about sales, as I'm sure you can tell. We specifically help founders through this pain. Navigating enterprise sales, mid-market sales, and really trying to crack that first million of ARR. Or sometimes even that first 500K of ARR if they move fast enough. And it is really hard. It's counterintuitive to what most people think, but it can be really, really fun when we show you the way.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And you described to me how it works, and I think it's important to clarify this. You basically embed with the team and help them do this.
Jen Abel :
Yes. So I fundamentally do not believe in outsourcing the heartbeat of the organization, which is sales. So what we do is we embed alongside the founder and drive a lot of the execution, but make sure that they are the tip of the spear engaging directly with their market, and learning directly from the market's mouth, not playing this game of telephone.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. And I mentioned this when we were chatting, but I think of it again, is when I was interviewing all these companies about how they started selling early on. One of the interesting threads that I heard again and again, is how many of them hired a coach or a consultant as a founder to help them learn to do sales. And that's essentially what you do. And I didn't even know a service like this existed, so this is super cool. It'll point people to what you do. I also have to ask you, the question I ask everyone at the end is just, how can listeners be useful to you?
Jen Abel :
Help each other out. I think so many people have helped me in my career, and in this journey, that the pay it forward model that exists in the technology space is so beautiful. So just don't let that die.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Beautiful. Well, Jen, thank you so much for being here.
Jen Abel :
Lenny, this was awesome. Thank you so much for having me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So awesome. So excited for folks to hear it. I've learned a ton. Okay, I'll let you go. Bye everyone.
