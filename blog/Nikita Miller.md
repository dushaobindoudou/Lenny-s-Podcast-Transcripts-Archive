**And that was a lot of my early product years and I just did it and it was very exciting and I quite enjoyed it, but even then, the flip side of it for me was I also was a runner back then, so if I was training for a half marathon or a marathon, then the next week I'd probably do my long run in the morning and not start work until 10**:

00 AM. That was my version of balance. And I think many of us are lucky enough, especially in tech, that a lot of companies get that form of flexibility. So now fast forward 13 years, it is very similar. I don't do all of the drop-offs and pickups for the kids, but there are some weeks where I'm like, "This is the week I'm going to do all of the drop-offs and pickups," or, "This is the day," and that's felt much healthier for me than this expectation that I'm somehow going to balance it all and everything is going to be equally great or cared for all the time.
Lenny (41:56):
I think what I'm hearing essentially, which I really like and agree with, is sometimes you're just going to have to go sprint and go hard and work really hard and go long hours and then that doesn't need to last forever. And then when it's not, enjoy that extra time and build and recharge and do the things you got to do.
Nikita Miller (42:18):
Yeah. That's about right.
Lenny (42:18):
I find the same thing. I find that just working hard is very correlated with success, and a lot of times that's just a lot of long hours and sometimes you can't balance it for periods of time.
Nikita Miller (42:30):
Right. And it can also be at different points in your life, right? So right now at this particular moment in my life, I'm probably not going to go hard at a super early stage startup because I believe that you probably need to be in person and working really hard together for long periods of time. And not everyone feel this way, I know that. I've had these conversations with lots of friends and colleagues. So personally for me, that's probably not the decision I would make at this moment in my life.
Lenny (43:02):
I get that. Another area I wanted to touch on is remote work and distributed work. I believe most of your career, you were remote or you worked with remote teams and distributed teams and that's such a on-trend thing now where a lot of teams are working hybrid, working remotely, working with distributed teams. What have you learned about being successful working with distributed and remote teams?
Nikita Miller (43:23):
Yes. My entire career has been with remote or distributed teams. That's right. When I started early my career, I lived abroad for a while. I lived in Shanghai. I had a core team there, but also worked for the distributed team in Europe and Latin America, which meant all kinds of crazy hours and lots of sprints like we just talked about. Things that worked well, one, documentation. It's a thing. Asynchronous communication, everyone just has to get used to it and better at it, so increasingly just being better communicators, whether it's on a video or written.
(44:00):
I think that's just really important, and everyone building up that muscle is really important. For all of the roles I've been in, this notion of what does it mean to have really meaningful and valuable in-person time that can sustain you for the remote and distributed time is a really important. I think a lot of what's happened now in COVID and even now, a lot of teams have never met their coworkers. They don't onboard in person, they don't have events or offsites as frequently. And I think flexibility is really great, but I think that really, that makes it really hard, and to me, what I've figured out I think is that it especially makes it hard to solve hard problems.
(44:43):
Solving a hard problem remotely with folks that you haven't spent in-person time with, that you haven't broken bread with, that you haven't disagreed with in person and built that trust is just really hard. In fact, it's much harder. So some of the things I've done even here at The Knot Worldwide is periodically when there's a really gnarly problem, I wave the flag and I say, "Hey everyone, why don't we try and get together for two days and hash some of this stuff out, and then we can go back to our remote lives?" And I think folks have been maybe unsurprisingly very open to that because I think they see not only the efficiency but the camaraderie that can happen there as opposed to what was happening potentially on a Hangouts or a Zoom call.
Lenny (45:28):
What does that event look like? Where do you do it? What's roughly an agenda?
Nikita Miller (45:32):
One, the agenda is pretty tight before we get there. Myself or someone else are responsible for making sure that that's a well-articulated agenda that we all kind of agree on before we even get there, so I think that's one. I think 48 hours, two nights, and that's important to me because it tends to still just be hours in a conference room or a meeting room during the day, but you do need to build in the, "And let's go have dinner since we're all in person anyway, or let's have an extended lunch and maybe an extended day." I think that's just really important. And even early in my career when I was working more internationally, the company I worked for was pretty amazing because two or three times a year, the entire company globally came together for a week or two and it made a huge difference, and many of the folks that I worked with there are still friends and mentors.
Lenny (46:29):
Are you able to share what was the challenge you're trying to overcome in one of these times?
Nikita Miller (46:34):
I can speak about it generally, which was just we had a change in strategy and we needed to land a couple of core decisions about what we might build. And there were lots of documents and lots of conversations, and back to the velocity of decision-making, remotely that can be really hard because with time zones, someone sends a doc, you comment on it, you get to the other day by the end of the week. And so days and days have passed and we still haven't landed it, and people have really strong opinions obviously that's something that big, so it's like, "Nope. Okay, great. Wave the flag." And not everyone could make it. Most people could, and the folks who could not were, yes, on a screen.
Lenny (47:15):
Was there anything specific in that offsite that helped you get to a resolution?
Nikita Miller (47:21):
In that particular one, it was one, very cross-functional and the unlock there was giving the data person the space to educate all of us. That was it. It was like, "You have the floor, educate."
Lenny (47:40):
I find that's often the solution is people just don't have all the same information that they're basing their decision on, so make sure everyone starts with the same foundation. Awesome. And that comes back to your push to get data integrated into every team and make that part of the four quad triad.
Nikita Miller (47:57):
That chair. It's the chair.
Lenny (47:59):
Anything else around remote work or distributed work that you found to be incredibly impactful or important?
Nikita Miller (48:04):
Well, the flexibility of it that I'm sure you've talked about with others, that is really important. I do think that Trello and Atlassian did this really well, is having standards around a couple things. The biggest one I think was overlapping work hours. So everyone had general flexibility, but there were some set of hours where everyone needed to be online at the same time for the most part every day, and that made a big difference. Onboarding happened in person. I think that in-person onboarding for new folks is really important for everyone. For any new person to an organization, I think how we work culturally, having a contact that you can reach out to, all of that I think is really crucial. I'm definitely of the so much of my early learning was in person and I have no idea how we're going to replicate that in a non-office setting. It's just really hard.
Lenny (49:04):
How long do you try to have that person in the office for onboarding? Is it a week? Is it a few days?
Nikita Miller (49:09):
A week.
Lenny (49:09):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit, just a few more questions. You mentioned you worked in China, you also worked in the UK for a while, obviously in the US now. What have you found to be some of the biggest differences in maybe the product culture or just culture in general working in these different areas?
Nikita Miller (49:26):
The confusion around what product management is is universal. That's not specific to US I think, and the fact that it's changing, that I think was the same. I don't know that I've found that many differences in terms of how we approached goal-setting, all very similar. The need for urgency, all those principles I think this are the same no matter where you are. Part of what I experienced when I started in Shanghai was the feeling that the product manager was expected to have all the answers, which as you can imagine was really overwhelming. And so I remember because I was young and I didn't know that much about product management, and I definitely did not have all the answers, I spent a lot of time helping the team help me get answers and that was a little bit of a culture shift in our team at the time.
(50:25):
And I actually think that's kind of carried me through my entire career, which is trying to figure out how to share the product management load so we're equally responsible for what we're building. So that was a good unintentional learning that I think has been really important for my career. I think that part of that learning that I've had obviously here and in London as well was the figuring out how to make room for creativity. So in Shanghai and also in London at the time, this was a decade now so many things have changed since then, there just didn't seem to be as much room for ideas to come from anywhere, which I think is also related to what I've seen before.
(51:13):
So making space for people across functions to share ideas and then across geographies to share ideas, especially in companies where English might have been the primary language but most of the employees were not native English speakers, there was a lot of time I think that I felt that I wanted to spend, and I did, on just creating space for people to comfortably share their ideas honestly. And that for me was really formative because I think it's really impacted how I've approached my entire career and I don't know that I would have, had I not had those experiences.
Lenny (51:52):
I was browsing through your LinkedIn post and you said something just like that on LinkedIn of just how formative that experience was for you. I know it's not something people can just say, "Hey, I'm going to go to China and work for a startup," but it sounds like you recommend working at companies of different cultures because it feels like it is a lens.
Nikita Miller (52:10):
Yeah. I do. I also think my family, I'm Jamaican, I'm a Jamaican immigrant, and so all of our experiences inform how we perform our jobs and how we think about problems. And being able to expand that, yes, I would recommend it to every and anyone that gets the opportunity. And I think it's really important as product managers because I think it's really hard to be a product manager if you cannot empathize with the people and problems that you're solving for, and being out of your comfort obviously is one way to learn empathy.
Lenny (52:50):
I love that. One final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round, not to not count those questions. Are there just any frameworks or processes or methods that you found to be very valuable in your career as a product leader that you would want to share?
Nikita Miller (53:08):
The question I ask myself and I ask everyone in my life probably, whether it's on my team or when folks, friends talk to me, I always ask, "What are you optimizing for?" That's the question, it's what are you optimizing for? And it's the short, medium, lon-term in product, but it's what are you optimizing for today, this quarter, this year? Whatever time horizon. And I think that can be just a really illuminating way of thinking about obviously just how are you spending your time? And I think it works for product as well. Every time we talk about OKR or goal-setting, ultimately it is what are we optimizing for some period of time. And I think that always for me, whether personally or in product, is very illuminating.
Lenny (53:53):
I love that. I'm pretty sure I've asked that question 1,000 times myself. One thing I find though is people get annoyed with you just like, "Okay. You're such a PM."
Nikita Miller (54:02):
I know, but it works.
Lenny (54:05):
It does work. What are some instances where you deploy this question? Is it in a meeting where someone's asking a question where you're just like, "What are we optimizing for here?"
Nikita Miller (54:14):
I ask this question all the time. I ask this question to my husband. What are we optimizing for?
Lenny (54:17):
I'm sure he loves it.
Nikita Miller (54:19):
He was a PM too, so he gets it.
Lenny (54:20):
Okay, okay. That's helpful.
Nikita Miller (54:23):
I ask this to my five-year-old, honestly. We talk about it a lot. Now we're going to quarterly planning, all of us, and now we have information from Q1 so let's look at it and say, "Given what we know now, what are we optimizing for? Because it might not be the same thing we did before with new information or it may be," and that's usually just then helping us get better at figuring out obviously how we're doing trade-offs-
Lenny (54:55):
That's awesome.
Nikita Miller (54:56):
... because if the first point isn't clear, then the trade-offs aren't going to be clear.
Lenny (54:59):
Yep. The other question is what problem are we trying to solve here? I feel like I need to make mugs and put these some mugs for product managers. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
Nikita Miller (55:13):
Yes. I don't think I prepped this, but I'm ready. Yes.
Lenny (55:16):
Okay. Well, it'll be the most fun then. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?
Nikita Miller (55:23):
These are not product books. I recommend Anna Akhmatova's You Will Hear Thunder, a book of poetry that is excellent. I recommend almost anything by James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time I most recently reread, and back to software, High Output Management.
Lenny (55:43):
What are some favorite movies or TV shows they've recently watched that you really enjoyed?
Nikita Miller (55:49):
I am really into K dramas right now, and actually-
Lenny (55:52):
Is that Korean?
Nikita Miller (55:53):
... Korean dramas right now. Crash Landing on You, it's great. It's a love story.
Lenny (56:01):
That's wonderful. Very out of the box. I love it. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask?
Nikita Miller (56:08):
For product managers, we think about product in the context of artist, scientist, general manager. Where do you spike?
Lenny (56:15):
Artist, scientist, general manager. Interesting. And is there one you ideally look for the answer or it depends on the role you're hiring for?
Nikita Miller (56:23):
It totally depends on the composition of my team.
Lenny (56:26):
Interesting. Cool. I like that. And a different triad. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?
Nikita Miller (56:33):
Arc by The Browser Company. I think they're a product that's clearly having a lot of fun and you can feel that in the product. When I first opened it, they have an unveiling experience, which isn't something you'd expect of a browser, and there was something really delightful about it.
Lenny (56:51):
Yeah. I imagine you've heard the interview with Josh.
Nikita Miller (56:55):
I did.
Lenny (56:55):
What a guy. What a cool product. I love it. We have a whole hour and a half on it, so check that out if anyone wants to learn more about Arc. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a tremendous impact in your team's ability to execute?
Nikita Miller (57:11):
Helping product teams try and use product, design, engineering and data to understand their shared roles and responsibilities.
Lenny (57:19):
Awesome. Call back to our previous discussion. And final question. What's a pro tip for someone trying to use The Knot and or one of the other properties?
Nikita Miller (57:29):
Ooh, good question. Two things, but the big one is probably checking out The Knot Worldwide marketplace. It is the most comprehensive two-sided marketplace to find your wedding vendors to create your wedding team, and you'll find that they're really cool small businesses on there.
Lenny (57:47):
Awesome. I'm going to go check that out. Nikita, thank you so much for being here. I'm going to go and ask my wife what she's optimizing for and read some stuff on the phone.
Nikita Miller (57:56):
Good luck.
Lenny (57:57):
Wish me luck.
Nikita Miller (57:58):
You said she's pregnant, right? She's optimizing for creating a human probably.
Lenny (58:02):
Yeah. That seems right. Okay. I'm not going to ask. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more about what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?
Nikita Miller (58:13):
You? I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn, easy enough to find me. I am very responsive actually, or at least I try to be when folks reach out on anything product related. And ask me questions. I think that's always helpful. If you have other ways of doing things, I'd love to hear about it.
Lenny (58:29):
You mentioned also that you're doing some angel investing. Is there anything you're looking for specifically that you'd want people to ping you about?
Nikita Miller (58:35):
I am doing some angel investing, maybe a little bit less so recently, but I'm starting to ramp that up again. So if there are any early stage seed or pre-seed companies out there, you can ping me.
Lenny (58:47):
Amazing. Nikita, thank you again so much for being here.
Nikita Miller (58:50):
All right. Thanks a lot, Lenny.
Lenny (58:52):
Bye, everybody.
