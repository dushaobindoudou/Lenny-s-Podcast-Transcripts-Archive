**Yeah, that's fine. Let's go with [inaudible 00**:

59:34].
Ryan Singer :
More concreteness.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Very concrete, very in depth, and then the appetites are... There's just so many elements of this that just connect with the way humans work versus the theory of just like, "Yeah. Well, let's see how long this will take. It'll be a great... and we'll figure it out as we're building. We don't need to really figure this out. Yeah. We don't have time for that."
Ryan Singer :
And we're solving a puzzle together, if it needs to be doable in this amount of time. But it also has to hit these points in terms of the problem we're solving. You know what I mean? It has to do these things, but in this time. One other thing that I would mention is that we can't be drawing Figma files. By the way, I'm being very mean to Figma so far in this conversation. There is a time when it's the right time for the Figma file. What we want to do is have that clarity around the... Let's say, we already know where the sink is going in the kitchen and now we can make final calls about the tile and the exact fixture-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Grout color.
Ryan Singer :
... and stuff like that. Right, grout color. We don't want to have to throw it all away every time something changes. So there's a time and a place where Figma is amazing and feels good and it's like, oh, now it's beautiful. Now, it's amazing. But in a shaping session, you can't collaborate on something so high fidelity. So we need also some ways to collaborate, and this is where you see these techniques in the book, like breadboarding and fat marker sketching. These are tools to help us express an idea very, very clearly in detail. We're going to hit this button and from this button, go to here. This calculation runs, then we get this answer, and then we have this choice to go here or here. That's the thing that we need to be seeing and that's the level of detail where we can move fast together but still see something real as more this breadboarding level.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Fat marker session is very evocative of what this whole session is about, is very high level sketches. That's a great term.
Ryan Singer :
The danger there that I often see is that what we don't want is to say, "Oh, Figma isn't the right thing at this level. So instead, we're going to do fat marker sketches," and what you get is the equivalent of a blurry Figma. Do you know what I mean? Just less detailed. What we need from a fat marker sketch for it to be valuable to us as builders is it has to really communicate the idea. When I look at that, I'm like, "Oh, now I get it?" And if it's more this general wire frame of dashboard goes here and there's going to be four reports, and it's like I still don't know what to build, right?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Mm-hmm.
Ryan Singer :
So if it's not telling me what to build, so maybe this is a way to come back to your question about what's the output of the shaping session, it's like it's shaped if we can give this to a technical person and they say, "Yeah, I know what to go build now."
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm very happy with our overview of the process. I think we've done a really good job giving people the gist. And obviously, if they want to actually implement it, they can get the book and dive in or work with you, which we'll point people to. Say someone's like, "This is awesome. I want to do this." What would you say is a good first step for a team that's currently... let's say, they're in startup land, and they're just shipping every two weeks, maybe every week? So maybe for that bucket of folks and then also for a larger company, I don't know, Agile Scrum SAFe, and they're just like, "Oh, let's try something different."
Ryan Singer :
Sometimes dev teams, they like the idea of not having the Scrum ritual, so they want to take in the six weeks, but unless the engineering and product come together to figure out how to collaboratively shape, like we talked about before, that time box isn't going to go well. So I-
Lenny Rachitsky :
They think they're going to not have to do standups, but now it's a day of hard thinking.
Ryan Singer :
Well, it turns into even more meetings, because we don't know what to do.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And the more meetings is just that shaping session specifically. Right?
Ryan Singer :
No, what I mean is that if we didn't-
Lenny Rachitsky :

**Oh, right. I [inaudible 01**:

03:46] right.
Ryan Singer :
If we only adopted the six-week cycle and said we're going to figure it out and we didn't adopt the shaping, then we just don't know what to do. And then we reached the end, and we're basically scrambling to shape it as we go. And then we run out of time, and then we feel like this wasn't... It was nice to get a break from the Scrum rituals, but we can't say that we are knocking the champagne bottle on the boat because we're celebrating the launch or whatever, again and again. Right?
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's a good, actually, time to maybe talk about there's obviously the spring kickoff in Scrum. What's main difference for people, because they may be thinking, "Oh, this is just like a spring kickoff." That's-
Ryan Singer :
Oh, that's a good one.
Lenny Rachitsky :
... big deal.
Ryan Singer :
That's a good one. So what you often see in a Scrum team is that there's somebody who creates these tickets of these are the things that are going to happen inside of the sprint. Really, in my opinion, too many cases, it's not the person who's doing the building who's creating those tickets.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So your product owner.
Ryan Singer :
So there's a big, big gap there. We could talk a lot about that, but there's gaps in context. The person who's writing the ticket doesn't actually understand the work that's involved. You know what I mean? So there are so many unknowns and time bombs waiting in those tickets that sound reasonable, but they weren't really created by the person who understands the work that needs to happen. So the key difference is two things. So in Scrum, you have a person who's not the builders making tickets, and this is what in the cruel picture is the paper shredder. In the shape-up world, you have a single idea that was shaped. This is the thing we shaped with the two months in the agenda view and da da. Go make your own tasks, because you're the professionals. Do you know what I mean? So the contractors, if you're building a house, they have to know the plans, but you don't have to tell them, "Now take the hammer and go over here."
:
That's their, right? So in a shape-up world, a kickoff is, here's the well-shaped idea, and now this time box starts. At Basecamp, it was really, really loose because they are just stocked with senior people. They have so many very senior engineers and all the designers are coding. They're very technical, really, really skilled people. What I found is helpful when the team is a little bit more mixed, if they're not all super senior, is a simple exercise of at kickoff, take whatever was shaped and just draw a grid with nine boxes, and give me nine boxes of the nine major chunks that you think have to get implemented from an implementation standpoint. So translate this into nine major scopes of implementation that need to somehow happen over the time box. So really, really useful exercise to kick things off, and we have a lot of teams doing that now.
:
If you take six weeks, that's 30 business days. You divide that by nine, it's four days per box. So you're going to get a lot of clarity from a quick exercise. And again, this is done by the builders. This is a really also good exercise for them to notice like, "Oh, wait a minute, we think there's too much scope here. Even though it seemed reasonable, when we put it into nine boxes, it's like, I don't think we can do this all." Or it's also a good moment where somebody who's more junior might describe their implementation approach, and then someone who's senior can review that and say, "Actually, we've done that before, and we'll run into this trouble if we don't use this other thing." So those really nice coaching moments can happen.
Lenny Rachitsky :
If you were to try this approach and have a shaping session, this is a sign you're heading in a good direction, is if the output, the team that's building it can come up with nine... Does it have to be nine? Is six cool, 10 cool?
Ryan Singer :
What I found is if it's more than 10, then you just get into ticket land of, here's a million things I have to do. You know what I mean? If you have 100 things, that doesn't tell me anything. But if it has to be nine or less.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Nine or less. Okay. Okay, cool.
Ryan Singer :
I actually think... I'm speculating here, but the UX designers in your audience will know about this rule of seven, plus or minus two. It's this cognitive science principle that was found about how many things someone can hold in their head at once. So this nine is the upper limit of seven plus or minus two, and it basically... It's like, do we actually have a picture of what it means to build this that we can also hold in our heads? Can we see the whole castle?
Lenny Rachitsky :
So what I'm hearing is if you're on a, say, Agile Scrum team today, if you want to start trying this out, it's schedule a shaping session, assume it's six weeks to start, try to come into it with a framing of here's the problem we're trying to solve. Is that a good way of thinking about it, like the problem we're trying to solve?
Ryan Singer :
Yeah, for sure. The question is what problem are we trying to solve, because the shaping work is more what are our options for the solution? And if the problem is too fuzzy and big, if the problem is just calendar, then the shaping is going to be this ever-expanding, never-ending thing, and we're not going to be able to get anywhere.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. Okay. So you spend three hours, maybe six hours in the first session. Would you recommend try to keep it to this many hours when you're first trying it up?
Ryan Singer :
No, I wouldn't do that. I think the key thing is actually if you get to the point where you're trying to hold a shaping session and you manage to get product and engineering into the same room to do it, you are far along. You're doing great if you're at that point. Oh, so much of the challenge is getting to the point of aligning between product and engineering that we cannot have projects that are dragging and dragging and dragging. We can't keep ending in a place where this is the end of a sprint or the end of a cycle and we still can't see the end of it, or we have to make so many cuts and compromises at the last minute that it's not the quality of... or it's not really matching what it was supposed to be in the first place. When those problems are happening or... Also by the way, this is surfacing at the exact level.
:
Imagine, you're the CPO, you're the CTO, and you are supposed to be answering to, "How's that work going?"
:
And it's like, "Well, actually, we're working on it. I can just think of a couple of times when I needed to go to Jason, and he expected me to be making progress on something and I had gotten nowhere on it. And that feeling when you are with top leadership in the room and you don't have a good answer for where you are on something is like... Oh, it's brutal, right? And then from the CEO's perspective, it's like, "Where's the movement? We're running a business here. Really, nothing is shipping still?"
:
This can't just keep happening. So there's some recognition somewhere either at the higher levels or within the team of, we don't want to keep dragging, we don't want to keep being lost in the weeds, and then this can be the activation energy. You gather the power to be like, "Okay, we actually want to try something different."
:
And in that case, what I would say is what usually works best is, okay, we're going to try a pilot project, and what we want to do is, as you said, choose a problem that's important enough to all of us that we think it's meaningful, it's going to be worth trying to do well. And it doesn't have to be six weeks. It could be something that is a little bit smaller, maybe you feel comfortable taking on three week thing for the first time. What's important is just matching these things together.
:
Here's a problem that we actually care about. It's timely, something that we would like to be shipped soon. It's not so small that we're not going to actually learn this new muscle, and it's big enough that it's going to feel like we really achieved something. So maybe that's going to be four weeks, maybe it's going to be six, maybe it's three, I don't know. And then getting to a place where we wrestle a bit with the problem to get the problem narrowed down. We get into our shaping session, and then we do our best. Do you know what I mean? And usually, what happens too is if we have an engineering team that's going to become free to do this work for those X number of weeks, that's the upper limit on how long we can spend to shape, and that's another real life thing, is sometimes we talk about if...
:
On the one hand there's this universe of never ending documents back and forth to get feedback and comments, and then on the other hand there's like the team is going to be available. We're trying to actually do this, so actually, we've got a week to shape because engineering needs to kick off next week. Do you know what I mean? That's a little bit more the real scenario when you're actually in this aligned world of we want to ship something now.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, real life constraints. That's a really helpful way of telling you how much time you have to do this. For people that are just like, "I don't know, any friends that are using this. It's like weird, this way of working. It's not a thing I hear about all the time." What can you say to them to help them be like, "Okay, I should actually give this a try. Here's how many people are using it. Here's impact that you've seen." Anything you can share that would help them get over that hump?
Ryan Singer :
I would say wait until it hurts more. If the unfamiliarity is the big problem with it, then maybe the things are fine. Because it's not like this is the only way. It's more like, changing is really hard, and if there's a good reason to do it and it's like, look, we've done it the old way. We've tried different experiments. We've even already churned through a new head of product, or we've got a different CTO in and we're still having the same problems, then there comes a point where it's like, I know that this is uncomfortable, and I don't know somebody who's done it, but I think we need to try something different because we can't continue this way.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That is a great answer. Following that same thread, just what are signs that it's time to try something? What sort of pain do you often see that's like, okay, you shouldn't look into this seriously?
Ryan Singer :
There are pains all along the journey. So I think the place where it's most obvious is at the end of the line when we thought we were going to be done and this thing is just dragging and dragging and dragging. The teams, we're not shipping things. We're running in place. We keep going in circles on this like we don't see the end. Of course, that's the culmination, but there's also a lot of pain points along the way.
:
So if we go all the way upstream, if we go to the source of a project, sales talk to a customer... You know what I mean? Or sales talk to a lead, and they have this idea of this thing we need to build, or the CEO had this idea in the shower the other day, or the product team did a whole bunch of research and they have a big case for why this is the thing that's important to build next. Whatever it is, there's a source from the business perspective of this is the thing we should do next.
:
If we just say dashboard and we don't negotiate what that means, if we just say calendar and we don't negotiate what that actually is, then what do we experience? This fuzzy thing where it's really hard to get to a conclusive answer about, yeah, that's what we need to go do. It's like the ever expanding blob. So if you've felt that before, that's already a first pain. And then of course, where does it go from there? So we say calendar, so we don't know what it means, but we say calendar, so now we give it to product and we've either got a whole bunch of Figma files or we have the PRD with a million requirements about what a great calendar is. Of course, I don't want to be cruel to the people who are putting their hearts into that work, because the Figma file is beautiful. It's just coming a little early. And the PRD is full of a lot of true things that are probably really important for decision-making in the project, but the way that it's packaged at that moment isn't something that gets absorbed. You write this document and I'm sorry, who actually reads it? You know what I mean? I know it's painful, but it's like that. And then even when we try to read it, because it wasn't shaped and we didn't get down to it's this, it's that, it's that, and that's how it works, it's hard to walk away from reading that and have anything that's in your head as, this is what we're going to go build. It's like a million puzzle pieces that you're going to have to solve. So what we see is either there's the Figma file and then there's the pushback from engineers. There's the PRD, but then it's like, okay, but we still don't actually know what to build.
:
There's all those things where, instead of moving forward, there's more and more questions, more and more pushback, more and more going back to the drawing board. So that's another big indicator that something is going wrong. And then when we're in the building and we thought we knew what we agreed to, we thought we all said, "Yeah, this is what we want to go make," and it's just more and more questions coming out. More and more unexpected complexity, things that we didn't anticipate, and it just doesn't feel like we're getting warmer and coming closer. It just feels like it's getting harder and harder. Those are all the signs that whatever process you use, that there's a lack of clear shaping and there's a lack of clear framing because there's a lack of clarity around what it is that we're doing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Before we started recording, you made this interesting point that there's always talk of feature factories and that rarely are they actually efficient factories. They don't actually work. Talk about that.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. Well, I understand what the feature factory critique is supposed to be. It's actually to the framing point of we're not negotiating the value and the outcome we're trying to get from something. We're just taking it and building it. And then of course, in the end, according to the feature factory critique, we just built it because somebody said we should build it, and then people didn't use it and didn't value it, and the product is just getting bloated. The thing is that, I would say if you have a feature factory, meaning you're continually cranking out features, you're probably quite healthy. All you need to do is feed a different input to the beginning of the factory.
:
What most teams are struggling with is that they don't have predictable repeatable shipping of things. At least from my experience, the bigger really widespread struggle is, stuff isn't moving, it's dragging. I can't see the end. I'm losing my... I'm feeling burned out. You know what I mean? It's not exciting to work on this anymore, all that a thing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Maybe last question here is what's the sweet spot stage for a company to start using Shape Up? You basically worked in this way from the very beginning when it was just three people. What do you find... Should startups that are just starting out start working in this way, or do you find it's more useful later on?
Ryan Singer :
We didn't formalize it until we had to, and there was a long time where there wasn't a fixed length for projects. There was just an understanding of the urgency and a feeling of what too long felt like. And it didn't actually click into, oh, this is a cycle length and this is six weeks, and then we pause, and this is who comes together to make the decision of what's the next project, and here's who is mainly doing the shape. You know what I mean? All that stuff didn't get solved until we had reached a certain size. Usually, the main tipping point if we start from smaller to big is there's a phase when the founders are still involved in everything, and so it doesn't matter what your process is, it's going to be fine.
:
But then you start to hire the first other people and then for the first time you try to delegate some of those things and the founders try to be less involved, and that's often where a lot of these problems start to appear. And the founders start to ask themselves like, "We used to be fast, and now we hired people because we needed to scale, but now we're slow. So how do we be fast again? Because we know what-
Ryan Singer :
... well. So like, "How will we be fast again?" Because we know what it's like. If we just got back in there as founders and got our hands dirty, like we could make this go. But how do I get the people that we've brought in to make these trade-offs and make these decisions and how do I get the work to flow again? So that's something that we definitely see there. So that's a really good moment. I'm onboarding new people. I don't know what to tell them how to work. I don't want to introduce a bunch of scrum rituals. Just winging it on Kanban isn't working, because they don't have enough clarity around what to go after. So I have to babysit them all the time. You know what I mean? Like these kinds of things.
:
There is another extreme, which is I... We've already gone past that. We've been scrum or whatever for years. The company has been growing, like revenue is coming in, like sales is doing their job, like things are running. But man, nothing is getting out the door. And we're years in and we have an entrenched development. We have like an entrenched engineering team, which is a wall away from an entrenched product team and everybody's apart. And this thing is like, we're like stuck.
:
And that is more where there's going to be some tensions that are starting to appear at the executive level. There's going to be some finger pointing. There's going to be some like, "Why isn't this moving? Why isn't this happening? How can we be spending so much money in all these engineers and we don't have anything to show for it?" And that's a point where there can be kind of a... Some hard conversations need to start happening about, "How do we actually start to negotiate around how we spend time?" And we can't just have endless refactorings and infrastructure projects, but we need to be actually building things that we can sell again.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What an idea.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. You know? But it can... There are a lot of engineering orgs that have been standing around for a while and it's all refactoring all day and tech debt and stuff like that. And there's reasons why all those things got there, but there comes a point where we have to figure out how to cut through it and make some hard choices so that we can carve out time to build the stuff that's actually going to be needle moving again and not just sustaining us where we are to run in place.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I imagine this latter bucket is who you mostly work with, the kind of companies that bring you in.
Ryan Singer :
It's been a lot of the folks who still remember what it was like to be fast and they're kind of newly too big and they don't like being slow. I've had a lot of that. I think that your intuition is right. That the market for the last category is the biggest, but it's hard to reach them. It's not easy to talk about these things. These are sensitive topics. Do you know what I mean? Like, "Our engineering team isn't shipping," and it's happening at leadership level. There's a ton of complaints happening deeper in the org, but nobody down in the org can change anything. At the end of the day, it's actually the interface at the executive level of being able to say, "How are we using our time? We have to change something."
Lenny Rachitsky :
To make it even more concrete in that first bucket, what's the size of org that you find is most in need of this? It's like, "How many engineers?" Or is it like when they hire the first PM? Like what's kind of the-
Ryan Singer :
I sometimes have the like, "How the heck do I hire the first PM and what do they do?" conversation. But usually, it's later than that. It's after they hired the first PM, after they hired the second PM, and maybe even the third. And they're getting to the... Product and engineering together are like 30, 50 people and it's like, "We thought we put everybody in the right roles. We kind of did what we were supposed to do and everything is just grinding. And why are we so slow?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Perfect. So 30 to 50-ish people seems like a good time to... Basically, you're finding that's when things start to really break down.
Ryan Singer :
That's when they show themselves and I think... I mean, if someone hears this and it all starts to make sense and they're earlier in that wave, then of course the earlier that you can anticipate it, the better, right?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. That's a good point.
Ryan Singer :
So if you're-
Lenny Rachitsky :
When it's too late is when they come out so-
Ryan Singer :
I mainly hear about it when it's too late. That's why they're reaching out-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Got it. So maybe closer to 30. Okay.
Ryan Singer :
Honestly, I think it starts the first project where, for example, the founding engineer is hands off and then the new hire is taking over responsibility. Or the person who was like sort of founder/CEO is first giving it to a PM to kind of thinking they're going to carry it through. And then, it's not exactly meeting their expectations of what they thought was going to happen. I think that's when those disconnects actually start. It's the first step away from the work where the seeds of all of these problems actually start.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I want to talk about Basecamp and how maybe not every company can operate like Basecamp. Before we get there, is there anything else along the lines of Shape Up that you want to add or share?
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. There's one key thing, which is the role of the PM. I think what we see today, out of necessity in a lot of teams, is that the PMs spend a lot of time chasing around inside of the build phase, inside the time box, to try and make sure that people aren't stuck and getting lost in the weeds and try and keep things moving. And it can sometimes be too close to project management rather than product management.
:
And what we see in Shape Up teams when they hit their stride is that the PM moves upstream. So the PM is less busy with, "How do I get this project to not be in a bad state when it's getting built?" And they're way more in, "How do I understand the business context? How do I narrow down the problem? How do I negotiate back and forth with maybe the CPO who brought this to me to understand where the core of it is?" That really getting the deeper understanding of the business and the problem and the customer domain and like what problem is worth solving and what's even slice of that problem is the valuable slice to argue that we should spend a few weeks on. That's the place where the PMs can really contribute a lot in the Shape Up world. That's kind of what they do, rather than shepherding the process or being a ritual master or something like that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That sounds pretty wonderful. I've been doing some thinking about what an AI-oriented world does to the role of PM and it feels like very similar to that actually, where the building now is going to happen for you with AI tooling. And that means the bigger question now is like, "What the hell should I build? And is the thing I've built right and correct and likely to work?" And it feels like this is similar, it's like the PM spending a lot more time upfront thinking through what to build. And then, the building is a lot more hands off. So hands off it gets done in like five minutes when you're just like, "Well, build this thing for me." "There it is."
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's see.
Ryan Singer :
I'm also very curious. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh, man. What a wild time. Okay. Let's talk about Basecamp. I think we talked about this ahead of the podcast that... You want people to know that Basecamp is very unique and not everyone can work the way Basecamp works. Just talk about your insight there and your advice there when people see all this advice coming out of Basecamp.
Ryan Singer :
I got to tell you, I had no idea how unique we were until I was outside and there are so many things. For example, it's a lot of the things that people ask me about that are not in the book that started to reveal those things to me. That's so many things that I was just taking for granted. I mean, every designer codes.
:
Imagine, if every designer codes and I don't just mean HTML. I mean, like running the app locally, going in to the place where that view is rendered to make that thing look the way that they want it to look or whatever, right? I mean, like really codes, every designer. So every designer codes, where's the wall between design and engineering? Where is the moment where you arrive with the Figma file and then the disappointment and all of your hopes get destroyed because the engineer is telling you no, right? Like those moments don't even exist in that world.
:
And then, also, I think also there was this lack of distance between sort of the business objective, the thing that we're trying to... The reason we want to maybe do this project and the blessing of the founders and the... Like, there wasn't this kind of executives far away with some big targets and then some layer of PM and then some building. I mean, the founders were always there, right there in the problem definition still.
:
I mean, I can't say today, but I mean up until 2021 when I was still there. So it meant that there was so much clarity all the time around what we're solving and why and why we're making time for it. And then, of course, on the engineering side as well. I mean, imagine, you have no sales org, you have no marketing. That all of selling and marketing is happening by the unicorn founders. So it means that there isn't contention for engineering time, that there isn't like all these different sources of requests that you have to wrestle with,
:
And David did such an extraordinary job of... I mean, the more I see the real world, the more I'm amazed at how every six weeks, there was clear runway in engineering of like, "We have time for whatever the... Whatever we'd agreed together is the most important thing." Just blank check like six weeks at a time. Not a blank check, but you know what I mean? Like a blank six weeks, yeah?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah.
Ryan Singer :
Again and again and again, years without end. Keeping that engineering capacity focused on readiness for product and totally leaning into what's exciting to do to build for the product. And not getting lost in all this refactoring and new infrastructure and technical debt and stuff like that. I mean, those are amazing. So those are some really big differences. And it doesn't mean that you have to be Basecamp to do Shape Up. But what it does mean is that when we say, "Oh, just have a shaping session and if you have the pressure of the time box, then you can make trade-offs together." It's like, "Well, if we are used to having a big wall between, for example, engineering and design, then we're going to have to learn..." Somebody who wants to start shaping is going to have to learn like, "Well, oh, I need to figure out who to bring together and how to have that session and how do we interact with each other. So that we are combining all of that knowledge that maybe at Basecamp was all in the same head in a lot of cases."
Lenny Rachitsky :
This is such an important point for people to hear, because there's so many people that come on podcasts like this and share, "Here's how to do it," based on their experience. And there's so many just assumptions about their resources, the people they hire, the way the founders operate. Like no sales team, I think that's like... I don't even think about that.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. Imagine, no such thing as a request from sales, yeah? No such thing as pressure of like, "We need this thing in order to upsell or to close this deal." Never.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It sounds like you're in this Basecamp... By the way, was it called 37signals? Like it's interesting you call it Basecamp not 37signal.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. I mean, so it's just like the timing of when I left. We were originally 37signals and then Basecamp became so big that we renamed ourselves to Basecamp.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I didn't know that.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. And then, so for example, on the book, it says Shape Up and there's a Basecamp logo on the bottom, not a 37signals logo. But then, since I went back, so it's 37signals again. So I sometimes struggle with I don't know what to call it but it's both. Whatever people can recognize, it's the same powerhouse.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. Cool. I'm glad I'm not the only one that's confused. But 37signal is the current name. Great.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So you said that it felt like you left and it was like this bubble you got out of. Was there like a moment where you're like, "You wrote this book. Everyone..." You're like, "Hey, this is how you should work," and then you're like, "Oh, wait. This doesn't actually work in real life for a lot of people."? Is there a moment there?
Ryan Singer :
It wasn't that this doesn't work, I was just in a foreign country. It was like we tried it and it didn't work. One of the common things I would hear is the projects kept running over. "We weren't finishing them at the end of the cycle. They kept running over and running over." And then, I would be like, "Huh. So can you show me your shaping work?" And then, they would show me a PRD and I'd be like, "That doesn't look like what's in the book." And again like, "Can you show me your shaping work?" And they'd show me like a bunch of Figma files.
:
And then, what I started to understand was like we have some people in a role who were used to making a certain artifact at a certain step and they just kept doing that. And I didn't appreciate... It took me a while to realize like, "There's no engineer in the picture here." And it was when we started to actually do the course, I said... Well, I did actually a couple projects where I helped teams hands-on and I learned that they...
:
It was the first actually consulting project that I did where I helped a team who was stuck. And what we did was we chose the engineer who was best suited to come over to product and be there in the shaping. And that was the moment when it was like, "Ah. Now, I'm in the world I know again," when we had all of that mixed in the same room again. And so, that was kind of like... That was really something... I mean, it was a total learning curve for me and there's a lot of things like that. But that was, for example, a really big one. It's like, "Oh, we have to get engineering in there."
Lenny Rachitsky :
You're the type of guest I most love having on this podcast, because you basically work with many, many companies, study what's working, what's not. You're not in the clouds pontificating about something. You're working with teams to make things better. And then, you take all of that learning, put it into a book, and share with us all. And so, the ROI is just incredible for us all because you've spent so much time doing this and you've actually done the work. You're not just in theory about it. So this is amazing. But we're not done yet. One question I wanted to ask is, Jason was tweeting that there's... He's working on a follow-up Shape Up book. What's happening there? Are you involved in that? What's the story?
Ryan Singer :
So I also saw the tweet. And I have to admit, I was a little surprised when I saw this tweet, but I had had a conversation with Jason a year earlier. And he reached out and he said, "Hey, we're thinking about doing a second edition of the book." And my first reaction... Imagine, I was actually really in the middle of learning all these things that teams need to learn in order to catch up to what was natural for Basecamp to do. And so, for me, it was like, "Interesting. I have a lot of new things. I have a lot of new ideas. Maybe collaborating on the second edition could make sense."
:
But what I understood was that what he wanted to do was to make an updated version of how they work, because that's always been a big thing of how... I should use the right name, 37signals, of how they market and also how they lead is they like to really show a clear example. Not like, "This is how you could do it. This is how some people do it," but like, "This is how we do it."
:
And I think it's their strength that they are very, very clear like, "This is how we do it and take it or leave it." What I understood was that if I did another version of the book that was just how Basecamp does it, I think it would leave so much opportunity on the table. Like there's so many people where what they need to learn is more like, "How can it come closer to where I am? If I have the wall today between product and engineering, how do I bring the right people together into a shaping session? How do we actually do that? How do I overcome all of these little challenges because this is so far from our current way of working?"
:
So the work that I'm doing with, for example, with shaping in real life is all about those gaps. And then, I don't know what's going to be in the second edition because they are... I guess someone there is going to be working on that. But what I'm guessing is it's going to be an update on kind of, "Up on top of the mountain over here, this is what Basecamp is doing." So hopefully, it'll be a cool thing to look at as like, "Here's a model of what they're doing." And then the question is, "What can I take from that and what do I need in order to actually be able to make it work in the real situation I'm in?" And that's kind of where... Well, that's my focus.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This is so interesting. Thank you for sharing. It sounds like a fork. You forked it and these are going potentially in different directions but inspired by each other.
Ryan Singer :
Mm-hmm. Totally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So interesting. Ryan, is there anything else that you want to share before we wrap up?
Ryan Singer :
One thing I could throw out there is sometimes people reach out to me because their projects aren't shipping, there's a lot of struggle, there's a lot of lack of clarity. But the root cause is actually that the input at the very beginning of the process is too unclear or... Like we don't actually know what's important to customers or we're not actually sure where the value is or this kind of a thing. So there is this link, this framing step that we talked about of, "What is really the problem?", before we go into shaping.
:
This is the link to product strategy also. And this is the place where it can be really useful to reach for a lot of, for example, Bob Moesta stuff with the Jobs-to-be-Done and the demand-side work, trying to get clear about big... So that's the tool that I reach for at that phase. And you can think of kind of this... Before the problem definition, there's this question of like, "What's the demand? Where are people struggling? Where is really the place, the itch they're trying to scratch?
:
And then, a lot of the Shape Up stuff is kind of when I have something where I think there's an opportunity or I think there's something meaningful there because of what we learned from customers or the job to be done, research, or whatever it was. Now, how do I turn that into something that we can actually go do and ship in a reasonable amount of time? That's the supply side. That's where the Shape Up part fits in. So maybe it just might be cool for people to see a link there.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's a great plug for a Bob Moesta episode. We talked in-depth about the Jobs-to-be-Done framework and how to actually apply it. What's the book you'd recommend there? It sounds like basically it's like Shape Up plus this book gives you a lot.
Ryan Singer :
Actually, the one that I recommend the most is Demand-Side Sales 101 and it's funny because it's like sales. Especially for a product person, you're like, "I'm the product person, not the sales person." But it's such a good dive into, "What are people really trying to solve?" And getting into that mindset of, "What's the struggle? What's the problem?" I think that's a really good entry point for that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. I don't love that title. I feel like you could have done better there with that book's title because-
Ryan Singer :
It's-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah.
Ryan Singer :
What's interesting about it is that it's very, very pointy for like if you are trying to make progress on sales, then it's this other kind of sales, this demand side sales. So I think maybe it's more for us who are kind of using it for different purposes. Like we're the product people trying to pull something out of it. That it's a little bit less aligned, but it's still useful.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. But basically it's like the Jobs-to-be-Done book is what-
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. It's kind of like the Jobs-to-be-Done book that's a bit more tactical. If you're really curious about the general spirit of Jobs-to-be-Done, then Competing Against Luck is a really good intro. That's the one that Clay Christensen wrote with a lot of... I think there's a lot of stuff that Bob worked on that's in there. But for a little bit more tactical like, "What's it look like to do the interview? And how to think about the struggling moment?" and stuff like that, this Demand-Side Sales is good for this strategy stuff.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. And we'll also link to this episode where you could get the gist of it in one hour's time.
Ryan Singer :
Oh, that's right. You did... That episode was great by the way. That's... Yeah-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Ryan. Okay. We did it. This was amazing. I think this is going to help so many people-
Ryan Singer :
We got through it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
We're not done yet. Two final questions for you. Where can folks find the book, find you if they want to work with you? Anything else that you want to share? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Ryan Singer :
Well, they can find me at my website. That's ryansinger.co. I'm also on X on RJS. I'm on LinkedIn. So just reach me there. And how can people be useful to me? I love hearing from people who are having these problems. If you're having these problems where it's like, "Things are dragging," or, "We can't see the end and we're not getting the quality we need," and all this stuff like man. I mean, this is how I learned all this stuff is by talking to people who are in it. So even if it's not clear what's the next step yet. If that problem is real, it would be cool to hear about it. I'd love to chat.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Be careful what you wish for about Moesta. He was just on the podcast and he told me he's got over a hundred LinkedIn DMs with people sharing their struggles with their job search. So here you go.
Ryan Singer :
Oh, yeah. Job moves, that's a big one. I think that's a broad appeal. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. That's true. I'm going to ask you to explain that when you do consulting work, just like how does that work? Who's that for? Just because I know that's something else you do.
Ryan Singer :
So it basically starts with uh, either often first CPO or CTO often reaches out first. And when it works well is when we actually get them together and then they understand that they need to change something or we have like a head of product and a head of engineering, that kind of a thing. If those two are both seeing eye to eye that there's a problem, then we can start a conversation around, "Okay. So who would be the right people for a pilot team? What are the things that are going on business-wise that could be a good pilot project?"
:
And then, I can help to figure out like, "How do we actually..." So almost like guiding through, like narrowing down that pilot project framing so that they have the support that it's going to be successful in shaping. And then, coaching the team so that they actually learn those shaping skills so that they can get through a session and come out with much more clarity. Like how do they actually run those sessions.
:
So it's kind of first working with leadership, "Who do we need to get to do this work? Who are the right people? How do we bring them into a pilot project?" Narrowing down, doing some framing work on the pilot, so it's going to be clearer in the shaping. And then, giving some guidance on how to get through that shaping with some feedback rounds. This is usually a good approach.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. And they can find this on your website if they want to explore this?
Ryan Singer :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Ryan, thank you so much for being here.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah. Thanks a lot. You had amazing questions. It's a subject that can go in so many directions and you kept bringing us onto some kind of a main track, so I'm really pleased. It was really nice. Thanks a lot.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I do my best.
Ryan Singer :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Thanks, Ryan, and bye, everyone.
