## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### Yeah, we have six people at the moment, so a really reasonably small team. I think with hiring, it's funny, man, there's so much hiring advice online and you read it and you're like, "Yeah, this is super obvious." And then when you live it, you're suddenly like, "Aah, this is why people say this." So a few simple examples are I think the thing that is really hard to find is somebody who really, really has a lot about doing the thing and will go that kind of extra 20%. I think when you hire out, especially not to pick on them, but I think if you hired a [inaudible 01

00:17] right, it's like people want a 400K a year job, they would like to work a certain number of hours, they would like to ship some code and then go home, that's basically the model that you get accustomed to even if you don't intend to when you work at a big company.

And so if you hire out of that for a really small startup, it can be really challenging because a lot of your success as a startup depends on each individual person being like, "No, I'm really going to, I'm work this evening i...

### One thing is probably just really fast iteration cycles. So placing a lot of bets and then being really rigorous about just going through that cycle very soon. I have this [inaudible 01

16:40]principles, and one of the things on there is basically saying EOP successes goes up the more bets you make, and it's sort of a function of how many bets you make and the probability of success of those individual bets, right? And so one easy way to almost guarantee that you'll hit something is just to make a lot of bets and then just kind of cycle through them very quickly. Now, obviously this is difficult, often this question of, well, is this bet actually failing or are we quitting too ...

**Yeah, we have six people at the moment, so a really reasonably small team. I think with hiring, it's funny, man, there's so much hiring advice online and you read it and you're like, "Yeah, this is super obvious." And then when you live it, you're suddenly like, "Aah, this is why people say this." So a few simple examples are I think the thing that is really hard to find is somebody who really, really has a lot about doing the thing and will go that kind of extra 20%. I think when you hire out, especially not to pick on them, but I think if you hired a [inaudible 01**:

00:17] right, it's like people want a 400K a year job, they would like to work a certain number of hours, they would like to ship some code and then go home, that's basically the model that you get accustomed to even if you don't intend to when you work at a big company.
:
And so if you hire out of that for a really small startup, it can be really challenging because a lot of your success as a startup depends on each individual person being like, "No, I'm really going to, I'm work this evening if that's what it takes to get this thing working, and I'm not just going to check my boxes, I'm actually going to look towards what is the real outcome that this business is trying to achieve." And everything I'm saying feels kind of obvious, but when you actually feel that difference between somebody who's just checking the boxes and somebody who's kind of an animal in this way, they'll actually go and pursue and accomplish the end outcome, that difference is very, very big and it matters so much for your first 20 people. And there's no science to finding these people. It's not like you can just put somebody who cares about outcomes in your JD and then suddenly you'll get all these people applying.
:
So then it's like, okay, well how do you screen for that and how do you find those types of people? And so that's where it gets really interesting. I think that's where the mission alignment comes in, and so you do have to find people who, for what you are doing, have this extra maybe private reason to care about it a little bit more than the average person. So I think for Palantir, they did hire a lot of vets, for example, or maybe people who were a little bit more patriotic or pro-America than the average tech employee, and those people had an extra reason to Palantir and an extra reason to try that little bit harder. And so what I'm doing is a little bit more in the kind of medical and health space, and so I think people who have themselves had experiences with this system have maybe had relatives go through difficult experiences with things like cancer or whatever it is. They're just that extra bit motivated to really care about the thing you're trying to do and then work that little bit harder, and so I think aggressively filtering early on to things like mission fit, how much have you cared about stuff in the past, and what's an example.
:
You ask questions like, what's the hardest you've ever worked to get something done and why? And that does differentiate a lot of people, a lot of people don't actually have a great answer to that. So I would say that's been a really big learning, is it's less about testing for the right skills, yes, that's important, two it's much more about just who has that extra 20%.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That is really interesting, everything you've shared is essentially around motivation, and drive, and passion, and kind of just commitment to working on this intently, and it's almost like a second thought of just like, oh, also they're really smart and skilled at stuff. It feels like that's just table stakes and this is actually what makes the difference in your experience.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah, I totally agree, and I think it's different for every business. So I think if you're in a space like B2B SaaS where maybe it's a little harder to tell the story of like, oh, this is so mission-critical, whatever, there are other ways of getting at this thing. So for example, I know a lot of people, again, it's a little played out now, but I know a lot of people who for sales teams, they will explicitly go for people who were professional athletes or played sports in college, and it's like, okay, what does that test for? It's like you are very, very disciplined, you're very, very goals and numbers oriented and you're willing to just work really, really hard. And so there's all these kind of lateral ways of getting at these qualities that I think you just have to be intentional about as a founder. As a personal example, I'm a runner and so I actually love meeting fellow runners and I kind of joke like, "Oh, maybe I'll go higher from run clubs or something like that."
:
But it's just same with I play a lot of chess, I love meeting chess players. I'm not necessarily saying that's the right kind of hire for me, but I think having this thing of here are some traits that seem uncorrelated, but which actually give you good signal to this person's personality, those are actually really important. The last thing I'll say just as a funny illustration of that concept is I think Max Levchin tells the story of somebody interviewing at PayPal early on and he passed all the skill interviews and then it just got to the final round and he said something about liking to shoot hoops, like he liked to play basketball, and they were like instant reject. The vibe here was like if you're not a mega Linux nerd, hardcore computer person, then we don't want you here, even if you actually passed all the tests just because you like to shoot hoops. Now whether that was the right call or the wrong call, don't know, but that's an example of what I'm talking about.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think that's a great echo back. People hearing this may be like, "What the hell? How dare they do that?" But this is exactly what you said at the beginning of our conversation, that like an approach to building a generational business is to be very clear about who this is not for, and that's okay, it's your company, not everyone needs to work there. And it's almost saving them time because they might realize this isn't for me, this isn't the people I want to be around necessarily. So I think it's important to see that side of it, is it's your business, it's important to be clear about who is a good fit for the company and who's not. Speaking of that, let's talk about product management for a bit. I know Palantir PMs are not traditional product managers. I imagine people have the title, Product Manager at Palantir, okay, so if so, as far as you understand what's the difference between say a PM at Palantir versus a traditional PM say at a FANG company?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Palantir was, as far as I remember, quite anti-PM for a while and eventually we did need them because we just got more serious about product testing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Classic story, classic story.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
A classic story.
Lenny Rachitsky :
In many companies,
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
The big difference or one big difference I noticed was that they were extremely careful about only making people PMs who had first proven themselves out as forward deploying engineers. You basically could not become a PM any other way. So as an example, when I mentioned earlier the thing that we built for the plane factory, the person who was managing that deployment, she later became the PM for ontology, and it was just because she'd kind of proven her method in the field. And the reason for that's pretty simple, it's going to be someone who understand how customers work and has that customer empathy, and it's going to be someone who has this drive to get things done because that's what BD selected for. I think the failure mode that they were very, very averse to in traditional PMs was this kind of Google Docs syndrome of like, okay, I'm going to write my product requirement documents, and I'm going to manage it in this very sort of sane, rational way I think, so the company was really rigorous about that.
:
And so basically PMs were almost always internal promotions and they always came from BD. I am not aware of a single case where we took somebody who was a PM at a place like Google, which produces many excellent PMs and hired them successfully into Palantir, it's just a very different vibe. So I think that was one thing. This is maybe more of a classic PM trait, but you just had to be either an engineer yourself or extremely good at working with engineers, and the ones I saw who succeeded the most were just best friends with their engineering team. And the team would always just be like one, it was called the group pm and then it would be a lot of very, very good engineers. And basically the success or failure mode was just do the engineers and trust you? I mentioned before Palantir how is very almost disagreeable personalities, and so if you didn't gain the trust of engineering team pretty fast, you didn't last very long.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think we've cracked the question of why are Palantir PM's so successful? First of all, the hiring bar is just basically hiring for leaders in a lot of different ways, to this, I don't know, forge for founders where they're working with a company solving a real problem, building a real product that makes money, and then those are the people that become the PMs at Palantir and then they go on to leave and that's why 30% of them end up starting companies, I'm surprised it's not higher, or become first PMs at other companies or heads of product.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah, absolutely, it's crazy. I was part of a pretty small team within Palantir, I think it was 20 to 25 people when I joined, and I think at least six of them now are either unicorn or just pre-unicorn founders from that group of 25 people, which is actually a crazy ratio. And then a bunch more have become founders recently at an earlier stage, so yeah, there's all these little pockets of excellence and it's been really interesting to see. I think the other thing that's driving that a little bit is when you leave, it's just such an interesting company to work at that I think the retention numbers were actually very high for that company. People would often stay a lot longer than maybe the average Valley tenure. And so when you left, it was really this decision of just something very specific is pulling you and you want to kind of play the next level of the game, and so it was very unusual for someone to leave and then join maybe a more traditional tech company. It's sort of like you're either going to go become a founder or why would you leave when there's so many interesting different things to work on? And I know that sounds a little culty, but that's what everyone thinks.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I could totally see that. A lot of people that left Airbnb have never found something more meaningful, it's just hard, especially if you're early. There's a stat that I didn't share that I think is really interesting, and when you look at YC founders and where they've come from, I think you maybe shared in your post that there's more YC ex-Palantir founders than there are ex-Google founders in spite of Google being something like 50 times bigger sample size.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's talk about the moral question of Palantir. A lot of people probably seeing the title of this episode, hearing this, will not be excited about Palantir being highlighted and promoted, a lot of people kind of disagree with what Palantir's doing. Builds products that kill people in some ways, they work with governments they don't agree with. I know you wrote a really insightful way of how you approach this question when you decided to work at Palantir and how you see people tackle with this, can you just talk about the framework that you landed on and how you thought about this yourself?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah, it's a really interesting topic, it's definitely very nuanced. I think what I was trying to say in that post was a couple of things. One was that there was a lot of upside there. So I worked on the US Covid response, I have friends who worked on Operation Warp Speed, and these are all things that I think saved a lot of lives, and I was pretty focused while I was working at NIH on cancer research. And so to me, these were just obviously good things and you couldn't do them anywhere else, and so that was alone a reason to stay. The question I had in that post was, well, okay, there are definitely going to be other pieces of this that people object to. So during the 2016 to 2020 era, it became a pretty common thing to go into work in New York and you'd have people protesting outside your office or doing all kinds of things. And so there was this question of, well, is this okay? And I think the point I was trying to make was it's rare that disengagement is the correct answer, and I think it's more recognized now, but especially then it went a bit too far.
:
So the famous example here is Google kind of disengaging with a Pentagon AI project just because some people felt that working with the Pentagon was itself morally bad. I think that's a way to sort of the left of what the median American would say, I think the median American would say it's fine to work on defense stuff within reason and assuming you're doing largely good things, and so there was just this kind of almost arbitrage there at some point of just hang on, it's not like working on defense is inherently evil, it's actually a pretty interesting thing. And then there's this question of, well, would you rather be in the room and making this better or not? And so I'm struggling with how much I can share here, but as a simple example, if you're doing even a workflow, which I think many people would not be super comfortable with, let's say you're targeting somebody for some kind of strike. If you compare the way it's done now to maybe the way it was done in 2010, it's going to be a lot more targeted, it's going to be a lot more accurate, and so you've actually improved that process and reduced the chance of error. Maybe you should feel good about that, right? Now, that is a bullet many people are not willing to bite.
:
I didn't work on the defense side of the company myself, but I think you have to be okay with these kinds of grade zones and actually actively thinking about what you are doing. And that doesn't mean that it's always the right thing to do to work in a defense company. Maybe we go into a very dark future and we start being the bad guys in some ways, and then it's probably not a great idea to work at a defense company. So it's a shifting landscape but I kind of felt pretty strongly that a lot of people in tech just didn't want to think about this at all.
:
So you have engineers now who are working on optimizing short form videos for higher engagement, and you sort of want to say to them like, "Hey, are you thinking about what this is doing to the brains of young children?" Or "Have you seen an 11-year-old kind of scrolling something for five hours and do you think this is a good thing?" And I think people don't want to think about this stuff too much. I'm not saying I know the answer, but there was almost this refusal to look at what tech was doing from a political lens for a very long time. It was just like, "Hey, let us play with our toys, let us sit in our little park, and don't bother us, and we're just going to build cool stuff and launch it."
:
And 2025, we're in a very, very different state of the world, tech is involved in politics now, and politics basically came to tech. There's this famous image of Mark Zuckerberg, he's sitting in Congress and he kind of looks very pale, and he's like, "Why have they dragged me in here again?" But I think tech went through this journey of, oh, we're suddenly becoming important now, oh, we're really, really important now, oh, we better stop playing this game of politics. And so I think what I'm saying now is a lot more consensus than it was 10 years ago, but at the time, the feeling was just like, "Look what we are doing is political, so you better engage with that."
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think when this became really real for a lot of people is with the Ukraine War, the government's running out of certain vehicles and ammunition, we're just not able to produce it, and then we're like, "Oh, thank God for a company like Anduril and all these other tech companies that are actually ahead and keeping us ahead." I think the only reason the US is ahead of that...
Lenny Rachitsky :
And keeping us ahead. I think the only reason the US is ahead of China and the space race is because SpaceX just is one company that just has been doing this for a long time. So I think a lot of people have kind of realized, okay, maybe we need these things.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Right. And I would make this argument as well, it's like people are like, well, how can you feel good about working in defense? And it's like, well, you're not going to feel great if China invades Taiwan, actually, you're not going to. I think you are probably also not going to like that outcome. So we do just live in this world where you do need to build up deterrents to these things and they better be good. So to me, it didn't feel that difficult of a question. I think when you zoom into particular things, they can be very difficult questions and there have been a bunch of those in the last couple of years. But yeah, again, disengagement isn't the answer.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. And again, it's not for everyone. I think that's an important kind of theme through this conversation is some companies ... like, to build ... sometimes to build a generational, really successful company, you need to turn some people off because that's what brings in the best talent oftentimes.
:
Okay. Just a few more questions. Kind of like stepping back a little bit. You're building a company again. What are a few core pieces of advice that you're bringing to your new startup that will inform how you build this company, from your experience at Palantir? We talked about a lot of stuff. Is there anything, I don't know if there are three things that you think are like, "I'm definitely going to do these things this way because it worked really well at Palantir."
Nabeel S. Qureshi :

**One thing is probably just really fast iteration cycles. So placing a lot of bets and then being really rigorous about just going through that cycle very soon. I have this [inaudible 01**:

16:40]principles, and one of the things on there is basically saying EOP successes goes up the more bets you make, and it's sort of a function of how many bets you make and the probability of success of those individual bets, right? And so one easy way to almost guarantee that you'll hit something is just to make a lot of bets and then just kind of cycle through them very quickly. Now, obviously this is difficult, often this question of, well, is this bet actually failing or are we quitting too soon, kind of thing. But that's kind of one principle I take, is just test this thing very early. You know, like the classic "why feed, why see" thing is just when you take something to a customer, ask them to pay you a lot of money and [inaudible 01:17:22] then find a new problem. Don't wait three weeks, which is what every founding team typically does because you don't have that kind of time.
:
I do think the importance of just having a really tight, distinctive internal culture and building a strong feeling of trust within a team is really important. And kind of like you mentioned with Airbnb, and people definitely felt this at Palantir, there was this feeling of like, well, you worked here, you must be good. I trust you, and all of that. And I think it's so important to create that and you kind of know that feeling. That's what ... like, people ask me, should I go work at place X or should I just go be a founder straightaway? I don't know the answer for everyone, but I will say one of the benefits of working at a place like that is you just have all these internal benchmarks now for, okay, this is what this should feel like, and if it doesn't feel like that, we're off. And I can't imagine not having those benchmarks and just kind of having to figure it all out.
:
So yeah, I think that thing, too, is just distinctive, internal, strong team culture. And then I think for me, think three is just working with a really messy part of the real world. So I kind of joked when I left, like, I am excited to just do pure software. I'm excited to, I don't know, I want to build an ID or something and just not have a support email even and all of that. But it turned out, look, my comparative advantage in a lot of ways was the networks I'd built and the experience I'd had in engaging with the messy parts of the world. And they do need technology a lot, right?
:
There's this horrifying thought I have sometimes of just like, maybe we'll get ATI in the next two years and the healthcare sector will still be broken and it will still be impossible to afford rent in New York City and build houses and all these things. And that may well become true. And so I think it's important to engage with those parts of the world too, even though they're really, really challenging. And I think the really nice thing about LLMs is that actually, there's so many workflows now that are accessible to you as a tech founder and people are somehow more open to working with tech companies than they ever were before. Selling into the sectors of the economy in 2015, incredibly hard. I think now post the ChatGPT moment, people are willing to give chances to small startups that they weren't willing to do previously. As you mentioned earlier, the cost of doing things like forward-deployed engineering has fallen by maybe five to 10 x now at least. And so there's a lot of new possibilities and I'm excited to engage with the best.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow, that is some alpha right there that you're finding, that some of these very large organizations are more open to working with startups, because classically, investors don't want to invest in companies that are going after healthcare companies and governments and things like that. So it is really interesting actually to hear.
:
I'm going to mirror back the tips you just shared, and there's actually a secondary tip that I think is the more interesting piece. So the first thing you're taking away is iterate quickly, but I love your tip of ask for lots of money quickly, early, to see if it's an actual idea that people will pay lots of money for. And if not, move on. I love that.
:
The other is build a very distinct culture, but the piece you share there that I love even more is this idea of knowing what a high bar looks like, knowing what awesome A plus people look like, and you need to work at a company like Palantir to actually see that. So the advice there I feel is just work at a company that is amazing, first, with the best talent, to understand what that should look like, plus you build a network of those folks. So I think that's really interesting.
:
And then the other pieces of advice you're pulling away is work on really hard, messy problems because that's where the biggest opportunities are, and it's sounding like this is the easiest time to actually do that. Amazing.
:
Okay. I'm going to take us to a recurring theme on this podcast called AI Corner. And what we do in AI Corner is we share some way that .. and this is you sharing ... some way that you've found AI to be useful in your day- to-day, either in life or in work. Is there any way you found some tool ... some AI tool useful that you can share?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Oh my gosh, there are so many. I'll give you a few examples. So I use Wispr Flow quite a bit. So this is the talk to your keyboard and it will transcribe for you app. Very good. It's just great when you are iterating very quickly with an LLM and sometimes you have to do these paragraph-long prompts and it's just easier to speak into them. So Wispr Flow, I like.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just to double down on that, you press a button and you start talking-
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And it's writing out what you're saying. Cool. And there have been these products for a long time, Dragon Dictate and all these guys. Is the difference now these are just very, very good now at actually transcribing what you're saying?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
I think that's right. Yeah, they use a really good model and so it rarely makes mistakes even when I think it's quite challenging. And then, yeah, the UX I think they just nailed. So that's really good one.
:
I love Claude Code for developing. Even though I have my complaints about it, there's something just very addictive about just telling it what to do. And it's basically something that you run within the terminal of your computer, and so you just type Claude, it opens up the Claude interface. It's very cute, it's very beautifully designed, and you just tell it what to do. And it actually operates on the file system directly. So if you're like, "Hey, create a bunch of these files," that'll just do it and you don't need to go and muck around inside Finder yourself. And then it'll do these really complicated pull requests and it'll basically execute them quite well. So to me, this is a very exciting kind of preview of AI agents.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's what I was going to ask. So this is essentially an AI agent engineer. I didn't know that's what Claude Code did. Very cool.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah. It's sort of a guided agent, but yeah, it is really sweet. And then yeah, I'm just enjoying ... you know, every week there's a new, wonderful new thing to play with. Last seven days, I've been testing Gemini Pro 2.5. Excellent model. I don't love Google's UX sometimes, but I was playing with that. And I use LLMs every day for all kinds of things. The other day I was doing taxes and I needed to classify a bunch of transactions based on some metadata, and so I just wrote a script up really quickly and it did that. So.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love just the smile on your face as you're describing all these AI tools. I think a lot of people are just like, holy shit, I'm just overwhelmed with all the things I need to be paying attention to. All these things I'm hearing, all these tools I got to try. And I love just this vibe of just like, this is incredible and so fun. We need more of that.
:
Okay. I'm going to take us to another recurring segment on the podcast. You're going to get a double whammy. Contrarian Corner. So here's the question. What's something that you believe that most other people don't?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
I think going to college is great. I think this is a somewhat contrarian view within tech, maybe not in the broader economy, but I often see people saying just like, oh, if you can just drop out when you're 18 and just start working, why would you go to college? And I think this is completely wrong, but maybe it's good advice for 5% of the population who probably would've been to your fellows anyway. But college is one of the few times when you can just make really, really deep friendships. You are in typically a nice campus. If you're in North America, you get to spend all of your time just thinking and writing papers and reading books and hanging out with your friends.
:
And it's actually very precious and it's very hard to find that kind of time after you turn 21 because you got to pay your rent, you've got to work, you've got to do all this stuff. Let's say you make a bunch of money, you take a career break, it's still ... all your friends are working and you always feel like there's a ticking time or on top of your head or something.
:
So just taking those three or four years at the very beginning and going really deep on lots of different intellectual topics and being able to try different things and discover more about yourself. I'm a big college fan. I can't comment on the ROI or whatever. I personally think the ROI is great, even though the fees are kind of high in the U.S., but that's probably my kind of contrarian within tech view is don't drop out of college unless you have a really good reason.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's so funny that that is contrarian and it does sound contrarian. I had a great time in college here. Here. Okay. Is there anything else, Nabeel, that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
No, I think it's a really exciting time in the world. I think AI can be exhausting, but it does really just open up the possibility of building a better world in all these ways. And so I think just reassess what you're doing every couple of months and make sure that it's aligned with where I think AI is going and make sure that you are working on something that you feel has very high potential if it succeeds. And I think that's more important than ever now just because the amount of leverage we have with technology is at the highest point in history.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let me double click on that real quick. So for people that want to do what you're describing, what helps you understand where AI is heading and just kind of align with it, are there places of information and news you find useful? Is it just play with it kind of thing? What would you recommend?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
This is the big question. I use X a lot to keep on top of AI, so I would just recommend finding a good Twitter list and maybe following people off of that. There's some good newsletters. I really like Latent Space, I know his X handle, it's Swyx, S-W-Y-X. I can't remember his actual name, but that one is very good and it's pretty technical. I would recommend trying to stick to the more technical newsletters if possible. I think there's a lot of philosophy about AI or AI policy type stuff, and I think that's good if that's your area, but it's an area where it's very easy to have a lot of takes on it. You're not necessarily learning a lot by reading those.

But I think it's just important to know what's going on and make sure you are revisiting your own workflows as often as possible. And just making sure that the people who went here are going to be the kind of hybrid cyborgs who fuse with the AIs. This actually played out in chess, if I can take a slight detour, is the chess players who succeeded the most in the mid 2010s especially were the ones who were really early adopters of neural network based chess engines. So when DeepMind did that thing, there was very quickly an open source version of it called Leela, and you find basically the very top players like Magnus Carlson, Fabiano, they were the ones who kind of mind melded the most with Leela and learned how it played and then kind of started copying its moves.
:
And so I think just becoming a cyborg to the extent that you can. And then I think there's this barbell thing of, it's also important to just leave everything at go touch grass just for your own mental sanity.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Excellent advice. And with that, Nabeel, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :

**The first one that comes to mind is Impro by Keith Johnstone. This is actually ... I wrote about it in that essay. It's one of the books that [inaudible 01**:

28:36] used to send to people. I just think it's a really interesting book. So nominally speaking, it's about improvisational theater, which I believe this guy was a pioneer of. He was a British guy, Keith Johnstone, active between the '60s and the 80s I think. And Impro is just this really interesting book about creativity and how social behavior works and basically just what he taught his improv students. It's a very weird book. It's full of these unbelievably strange ideas. There's a lot of very tactical things he tells you to do in the first chapter, for example, just to break out of your own mental frameworks, really just wild stuff.
:
He'll tell you to walk backwards while counting down from a hundred and think about some problem that you're struggling with and there's all these kind of odd things. But the number of ideas per page I've found on that book is extremely high. The concepts about how social interaction works and how things like status and so on play into your social behavior are super important. And they made every kind of fully deployed engineer read that for the simple reason that I think it just helps you kind of read people better and interact with them better and become more conscious of how you are coming across and just modulate that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What is the title again?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Impro.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Impro. Okay, cool. We'll link into it in the show notes.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah, so Impro is number one. I think just to go a little more highbrow, maybe Shakespeare's history plays, there's a set of them called the Henriad, so like Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI. I find most people don't read these, so they'll read Hamlet or Macbeth or whatever, but the Henry one is absolutely incredible. You don't have to be interested in British monarchy or British history in order to enjoy them. They're actually some of the most interesting and insightful books I've read about power and how power works and politics and what the sacrifices that you might have to make if you want to be a successful king in that case. But it transfers over.
:
I think it is worth thinking really hard about, I think especially in a world where everything is kind of organized around these prominent figures and personalities now. When you think about the current administration, you think Trump, Elon, or when you think about AI, you think of Sam Dario, right? And so I think it's important to understand, how do you think about these personalities and yeah, the kind of game that they're playing. And Henry is actually ... the Henriad is an incredible kind of set of books around that.
:
They're also easy to read, which sounds hilarious when I say it, but you can read a Shakespeare play in a day. They're sort of ... I don't know, they're like 50 pages long. It's not that bad. You have to get used to the language. Yes. But I would recommend that for sure. I guess you asked for two to three. I love High Output Management by Andy Grove. I just think that's a great business book, and people tend to read summaries of it on the internet more than they actually read the book. But the actual book has a lot of really interesting stories and explanations about ... I think the most powerful thing about that book is actually how Andy Grove thinks, and less any of the specific tactics there. And I think you don't get that unless you read how he came up with all these things.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Your first two books were extremely out there versus what other people have recommended, and the third book was the most recommended book on this podcast. So I love that spectrum that we just went on. Perfect. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've just really enjoyed?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
The last movie I really loved was a Decision to Leave. It's a Korean movie. It's by the Director of Old Boy, which maybe some people have heard of. It's a great movie. I think it was released a couple years ago and the basic premise is, there's a detective who is investigating a woman who's accused of killing her husband, and he gradually starts falling for her, which starts to affect his judgment in all these ways. Just a really fascinating kind of psychological thriller with a sort of romantic element to it. Visually, very beautiful. Yeah, I think a lot of the most interesting movies nowadays come from abroad actually. So East Asia, South Asia, places like that. TV, I don't watch so much yet. It's been a while.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Totally understandable for a founder. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you just really love? It could be an app, it could be something physical, it could be a water bottle.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
I don't have a good answer to that one. I guess I don't buy enough stuff.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Fully acceptable. There's no wrong answers in the lightning round. Moving on, do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you come back to, that you share with friends or family?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
So there's this architect called Christopher Alexander who wrote these beautiful books that are about beauty and kind of more than architecture. And he was a teacher at UC, Berkeley, and he got really frustrated with the students because he just felt like they were always turning in kind of average work. And so he would always tell them every week, imagine there's a gothic cathedral in France called Charge. And he would say, you have to aim for Charge. You have to make something that is better than that. That should be your goal, not to just turn in something that's what you feel is good enough. You actually have to try and be better than the very, very best that ever did it. And I find myself just repeating this a lot to myself. It's just aim for that, really try and do that. Otherwise, it's very easy to anchor on something right in the middle. And you do this unconsciously all the time.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So is that the motto, just aim for Charge?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that. Most people have no idea what that would be, but with the context is quite powerful. Final question, what's a classic novel that `you think would be most valuable for product builders?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
My favorite novel is Anna Karenina, and I would recommend that everyone read Erica.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm reading that right now. I've never read it before.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
No way. And yeah, so it's by Leo Tolstoy. It's this epic 19th century Russian novel that follows a set of characters across society. And I think it's just extraordinary because what's amazing about him is he's just able to imagine himself into the brain of anybody. And so even ... he will briefly just go into the consciousness of, I don't know, the servant who's bringing the meal to the table or something like that. And he'll just tell you a page of what they were thinking, and then he'll just flip back into his main character's head. And I think that is the most impressive demonstration of this kind of skill I've ever seen.
:
And I think, to connect it to your question, this is what you have to do if you're going to be really good at product, is you have to really think yourself into the other person's head, and you have to be really seeing it the way that they do. And it's so hard, especially as a founder or product person, not to just get stuck on your own way of seeing the problem, right? You wrote up this doc, you made these marks. You're like, this is going to be great. And then you take it to somebody, they don't care that much. You really have to exercise your empathy and understand why they see it that way and what they actually care about.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What a beautiful way to bring it all together. Let me also add, while I'm reading the book, something ... a tip here is, people talk about having Chat GPT voice mode, just kind of sitting there next to you. I found that extremely helpful with this book where I just ask what the hell does this thing mean? There's all these Russian dances and balls and etiquette. You just ask and you're like, I'm reading Anna Karenina, what does this mean? And it just tells you.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So there's another cool tip for AI. Okay. With that, Nabeel, this was incredible. Two final questions in case people want to look you up. Where can they find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Find me online, my website is nabeelqu.co and my X handle is Nabeel QU, I'm probably most active on that, but yeah, my website has all the links and a bunch of essays and interesting stuff. How can you help me? I would say send me an email. My email is on my website. Introduce yourself, say hi. I love meeting people. I don't always have time for coffees nowadays or things like that, but I genuinely do get a lot of energy from just receiving emails from interesting people, so please do reach out.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Definitely check out Nabeel's Principles. Is that the name of that post?
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Great. Okay. That's one to start with, and then also there's the Palantir Post that we just talked through. Okay. Nabeel, thank you so much for being here.
Nabeel S. Qureshi :
