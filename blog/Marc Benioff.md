**I don't know how long this goes. [inaudible 00**:

29:49].
Marc Benioff (29:48):
They are cool. I am lucky that I've met a lot of cool people. Yeah. I don't know how I got so lucky to meet some of these people.
Lenny Rachitsky (29:53):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about... Every month or so, I hear about a startup, I do a bunch of angel investing, that's trying to basically disrupt Salesforce, come after Salesforce. They bash your... don't kill me for saying this, your user experience. They're like, "Oh, so complicated. It's been around three to five years."
Marc Benioff (30:11):
We are too complicated. I agree.
Lenny Rachitsky (30:12):
Okay. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow. We're recording this today, and your stock is at an all-time high basically even now.
Marc Benioff (30:25):
Wow, I didn't even know that.
Lenny Rachitsky (30:27):
Roughly.
Marc Benioff (30:29):
I actually never look at the stock.
Lenny Rachitsky (30:29):
Okay.
Marc Benioff (30:31):
I find the stock to be very distracting, and I encourage my employees also don't look at the stock because the stock is just a reflection. Money isn't the goal, right? The stock isn't the goal. It's coming at the end of the journey. It's like that's not why we're doing this. The journey is the reward. That's also something Steve Jobs would say all the time. Another bow to Steve Jobs here. I think that this is really important, and I look at myself as a startup.
(31:05):
I am a startup CEO. I'm a startup entrepreneur. I'm still at the beginning of Salesforce. No matter what I'm doing at Salesforce, whether I'm the CEO, I'm sometimes the chair of the board. Like, last week, we had a board meeting. Sometimes I'm a product manager. This is a startup, and we're a 25-year-old, 75,000-person, $38 billion, $300 something billion market cap startup, but we're a startup nonetheless. We have some great products, but we are just starting. As an example, Lenny, we are just starting the digital labor industry, and we have a product called Agentforce, and we are just starting. We are just at the beginning.
Lenny Rachitsky (31:47):
I want to bounce around a little bit, but let's talk about Agentforce. I know this is, as you've said, the thing you're most focused on right now. It's a big bet you all are taking. When people hear this word "agent," I think a lot of people are embarrassed to even ask like, "What does that even look like? What is an agent beyond what LLMs are today?" Is there an example you could give of something you've seen that maybe blew your mind of what an agent can do?
Marc Benioff (32:09):
Yeah. I saw it in the movies. I saw it in Minority Report, which was a movie that was co-written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz. Tom Cruise runs into the Gap store, and all of a sudden, it says, "Hey. Hey, Tom. Have you thought about this new shirt? Look at these jeans. You bought this last time. Now, you could try this. You could try that. What about this? What about that?" It knew his history. It understood him. It knew what was going on. This is 20 years ago. This whole store changes digitally to reflect his interest, his ideas, and it's starting to talk to him and work with him.
(32:51):
That is an agent. It isn't just the agent that we saw in the Matrix, Mr. Smith, or whatever it is. It's someone that's working with you, someone. That's an interesting, for you, slip. It's something that is working with you. It could be your piece of software in your phone. It could be a robot that's going to be in your home. It could be your car that knows you, understands your preferences, has an institutional memory of you, and now is helping to advise you.
(33:22):
I'll give you an example that I'm going to... I go into UCSF all the time. I'm actually just getting through an Achilles rupture right now, so I've had a lot of interactions, and the hospital... or you're getting your healthcare, getting your labs done, getting your physical done, getting your scans done, whatever it is. There's always these pre-operative and post-operative or pre-procedure and post-procedure things, and you're getting these phone calls. Every time I get a phone call, I'm like, "Ugh, that probably just cost them a hundred bucks, and we probably could do that a lot cheaper and a lot easier with an agent."
(33:58):
Then, when I talk to my doctors and nurses at UCSF, they're all burnt out post-pandemic because they're scheduling pajama time to go through all their digital messages at night. It's like a lot of this could be done a lot easier with agents and AI, and we're going to make their lives a lot better, a lot easier, simpler. Some of those things that they're doing, they don't need to talk to me about what my cholesterol number is because I got my labs, and the cholesterol number is this number or that number. A lot of this can be done with technology, and then save the parts that are important for them like when I come to see them or I want to have a real, deeper, more empathetic conversation face-to-face with a deeply experienced doctor. That's a whole another opportunity for me.
(34:45):
That is an agent or the agent is like... Here's an example. I had a CT scan, and you have to drink this contrast, and then all of a sudden, the... drink it, but they give it to you through an IV, and then they're taking better pictures. But then, you have to drink water to flush the contrast out of your body. Do you think anyone called me and said, "Hey, did you drink the water?" No, nobody calls me to drink the water. You have to remember. You're on your own in healthcare in the US. So the agent is going to call you and say, "Hey, did you drink the water? Did you take your meds? Do you need to have a repeat lab? Do you need to go see your doctor again?" So the agent is going to be there by your side. So that's an healthcare example. There's a lot of examples that we can probably have.
Lenny Rachitsky (35:25):
There's just a story in The New York Times which isn't about agents specifically. It was about comparing ChatGPT to a doctor where they tested a doctor's ability to diagnose versus a ChatGPT directly or a doctor plus ChatGPT. By far, the best was just ChatGPT, removing the doctor from the equation.
Marc Benioff (35:43):
Yeah. They wrote up a clinical study where they actually did look at, in a semi-peer-reviewed way, that ChatGPT, in many cases, was giving more accurate diagnoses than a doctor because the doctor had a more bias coming in working with the patient. So that's super interesting and I think something that we should probably all look at that study and think about that.
Lenny Rachitsky (36:09):
Speaking of The New York Times, there's actually this quote I found. You did this op-ed talking about AI. So the quote is, "Throughout my career in Silicon Valley, I've witnessed numerous waves of innovation, but none compared to the profound impact of AI. AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime." When was the moment for you where you started to realize this where it's like, "Oh shit, this is not just another cool toy?"
Marc Benioff (36:33):
Well, I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI, and it's happened over a series of decades. But for those of us who grew up with these movies like WarGames and Minority Report or Her or... across the board or read some of these books. One of my favorite books on AI is Ghost Fleet. You think about, "Where are we going with AI? Where are we going with AI?" With Salesforce, I think about our journey, and I've been waiting for this to happen and trying to bring us along, especially in the last decade with the development of our Einstein platform, and now the development of our Agentforce platform.
(37:18):
This week, at Salesforce, we'll probably do about 2 trillion AI transactions. With our total now, Einstein and Agentforce platforms, we're definitely the largest provider of enterprise AI transactions in the world as far as I could tell, and I keep thinking, "Wow, this is going to get more and more intense." One step was we had to automate all these customer touch points. So like wearing my Disney fanboy shirt here, we run the Disney Store and the Disney Guides, and there's Disney Real Estate, and there's the DisneyQuest call center, and there's... Every aspect of Disney. When you're a customer, you're interfacing with Salesforce.
(38:00):

**So that's what we've loved doing, automating all these customer touch points**:

sales, service, marketing, analytics, Slack, integrating it all with MuleSoft. That's what we do, and then aggregating it all into a big database where we call it data cloud, and then federating that data cloud to other data sources. So that's the two steps we've been doing, automate the customer touch points, aggregate the data, and then step three is the agentic platform on top of that.
(38:29):
When you think about what's happening now that you can go to help.salesforce.com and have your issues resolved with that on the agentic layer, that's amazing. Then, the fourth layer that will come will be the robotic drone layer where those robots and drones will then feed off of the platform and all of these capabilities. That vision of the future is something that we've all had in the industry for years. It's not my magic vision. This is a vision that's been around. It's been the fundamentals of computer science that we would move from having... We'd go from data to automation, and that is what we're all driving, and we're driving that industry. We're going lower cost, easier to use, and more automated constantly. That's powerful. This is really moving fast.
Lenny Rachitsky (39:21):
You mentioned Einstein briefly. I'll also mention my dog is named Einstein, and I got Einstein swag once with the socks, and I love them, so. Also, that's also an example of you bought einstein.com very early.
Marc Benioff (39:33):
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky (39:34):
That was another domain name that you owned.
Marc Benioff (39:36):

**Well, I just thought Einstein would be a great name to talk about artificial intelligence, and it really has been. There. You can see him behind me right on my shelf, on my bookshelf. I keep him back there. You see Einstein? I think they were [inaudible 00**:

39:50].
Lenny Rachitsky (39:36):
My view is blocked.
Marc Benioff (39:36):
Oh, I'll go grab him.
Lenny Rachitsky (39:52):
Totally. Okay. Let's check it out.
Marc Benioff (39:54):
There he is. Ugh.
Lenny Rachitsky (39:55):
Show and tell Segment in the podcast.
Marc Benioff (39:55):
Oh, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky (39:59):
Oh, cute.
Marc Benioff (40:00):
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky (40:00):
That's a big old Einstein.
Marc Benioff (40:02):
That's a key part of our vision for Salesforce, our Einstein platform was everything we're doing. We wouldn't get to Agentforce without getting to good old Einstein here.
Lenny Rachitsky (40:12):
Very cute. As you talk about all this, I imagine many people are thinking, "Oh shit, we're not going to have as many people working. What are we going to do with our jobs? AI as agents." I know anything you say could be taken way out of context and just like, "Marc Benioff says everyone is not working," but I guess just... I know you've said you're not going to be hiring as many engineers next year. I guess anything there to help people understand how the workforce will change in the future?
Marc Benioff (40:35):
Well, I can tell you about my own company and what I'm telling my own employees, which is that, yeah, we're going to have to rebalance some of our workforce because you can see it in the numbers I just gave you which is we need less support engineers because we have a robotic support layer with Agentforce. So that is very real, and we all need to adapt. At the same time, I'm hiring a lot more account executives and folks to grow the company. So I just encouraged everybody on the all-hands call to think about that.
(41:06):
Then, I just gave you the idea of healthcare. The interesting thing about healthcare though is that a lot of the jobs that I think that are going to get created just... we don't have people for, and I think there's a lot of things that we need help with in the world that we don't have people for. So I think a lot of these jobs will not necessarily get replaced, and I think that... I have a home in a small town, and in this small town... It's very much a blue-collar town. Folks are still working in the restaurants, driving trucks, working in the supermarket, and working on their homes, building, construction, gardening.
(41:56):
Look, it's going to be a long time before, I think, jobs in the small town where I have a home will ever get impacted. But in the large town where I have a home, San Francisco, well, then I just gave you an example where I think that jobs will get impacted. So it'll be a tale of two cities, literally, and I think you will see different impacts in different places.
Lenny Rachitsky (42:21):
So what I'm hearing there is support people trending down, account executive sales trending up?
Marc Benioff (42:27):
Right now, that is Salesforce in a nutshell.
Lenny Rachitsky (42:31):
That touches on something I wanted to touch on also which is that you're... A lot of founders today are very product-minded, very product-oriented founders, and they want to build product-first companies, grow product-led, all these things. Salesforce, I think, very publicly, is very sales-led, very marketing-led, not product-led. Obviously, product is a core part of it, and it all works together, and all these things. But I guess just any advice for founders that are very product-oriented and maybe are hesitant to lean into sales, into cust-
Marc Benioff (42:57):
Yeah. I would say we're not sales-led. Well, I think let's just use Agentforce as an example, right?
Lenny Rachitsky (43:01):
Mm.
Marc Benioff (43:01):
So we're running the year, we're running this year. This is our fiscal year 25. Okay? It ends in the end of January next year. Lenny, this is the year of data cloud. This was not supposed to be the year of Agentforce. So it's the year of data cloud. I just gave you the pitch. We've automated all the customer touch points. Now, we're adding the data cloud to all of our customer implementations. We have 135,000 customers. We've implemented data cloud into all of them. They all need to turn it on. Our teams need to show our customers how to build data cloud and how it's going to help our customers have a better data structure. I almost combined "beta" and "data" together. So they need a better data structure, data architectures, data cultures.
(43:51):
Then, we had our breakthrough, and I can tell you the story where all of a sudden, I'm like, "Wow, this agent technology is happening much faster than I thought it was going to, and we are going to market now." By the time we get to Dreamforce, we are going to take this incredible technology. We accelerated it radically because we bought this company called Airkit, which is one of our Ohana... It's a great story.
(44:18):
Great entrepreneur have this company, fantastic company called RelateIQ that we bought many years ago, about 10 years ago, stayed with us for many years, like six or seven years, wanted to leave, and we said, "Great." We gave them the investment to leave, invested in the company through Salesforce Ventures, built this amazing platform, and then we said, "Now, we want to buy it back." Then, he came back about a year ago, and then it just accelerated the agent vision, and then we delivered Agentforce production code at the end of October. So, all of a sudden, now, we are releasing this product.
(44:56):
I think it's very important, if you're an entrepreneur, to realize it's not just about the product. It's not just about sales. It's not just about marketing. It's not just about accounting. It's not just about your investors. It's not just about your employees. It's not just about your stakeholders. It's about everything, so you better be ready to be an orchestra leader. You can't just be playing the clarinet.
(45:20):
I think that's what you're getting to, which is that there's entrepreneurs who are like, "I'm just going to play the clarinet." For those, I don't think they're going to go as far as they could go. You want to be playing the whole symphony, and you want to get everyone running. That symphony is sales, service, marketing, product. Every part of your shareholders, your stakeholders, your customers. You have to be constantly playing the whole symphony, and you have to have a big mind to think about, "Whoa, I have a lot of stakeholders in my company, not just one stakeholder." It's not just about product and technology. If you're going to narrowcast yourself, you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everybody else as well.
Lenny Rachitsky (46:02):
Speaking of big mind and beginner's mind, we have a recurring segment on this podcast that I call Fail Corner. Where it comes from is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of, "Everything is going great. We're killing it. I've had all these successes," and people get discouraged because they hear just people only succeeding when they often fail. So I try to ask guests to share a story, and let me ask you this. Is there a story you could share when it was a big struggle for you when you're struggling when something went super wrong that you worked through and learned something from?
Marc Benioff (46:35):
Sure. Well, I'll just give this example. About two years ago, we went through this huge transformation in our company, and there were a lot of crazy things that were happening, but it was a little bit like we're all on this Airplane, and everything is going really well. Then, something seems to be going really wrong, and we look up front, and the two pilots seemed to be missing. Then, the one guy with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and then we're all like, "Whoa, what are we going to do?" We had to do some really crazy and somewhat destructive things at the moment to basically get the regeneration of the company.
(47:12):
One of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company, and I didn't want to do it. I mean, it's the last thing I want to do as an entrepreneur, which is to adjust our headcount, but we were coming out of the pandemic, and we had just hired too many people.
(47:33):
Now, it turned out that a lot of companies in Silicon Valley all did that same maneuver during the pandemic. Things were so robust in the pandemic that we were overhiring. By the time the pandemic was over, we had too many people. I mean, what did I know? It was my first pandemic. All of a sudden, my next pandemic, I'll know that there's an economic cycle associated with it and an inflation cycle too.
(47:58):
So I learned a lot in the pandemic, and now, we're here. Now, all of a sudden, we're architecting two years ago this layoff. Then, when we did the layoff, then I'm trying to overcommunicate. I'm having all employee meetings. It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me. It's like, "Oh, boy." If I had a thick skin, it got a lot thicker during that moment because it's never going to go well no matter what, and it didn't go well but we got through it to the point where you're giving me these accolades, wonderful, on this podcast about where we are today financially and from a structural standpoint or now from product innovation standpoint, but that's not where we were two years ago.
(48:51):
It was clear we had to go through a financial transformation, which included an adjustment of our head count, and we had to go through a technology, and a product, and an innovation transformation. Those two things were going to require us to do a number of things, and they were going to be painful. So we all had to go through some of that pain to get the gain that we have now, and that was not easy.
(49:17):
I was in shock that I was going through this two years ago because I had already been running the company for 23 years. Things were going pretty well. Yes, there were a lot of failures during that period. I just didn't expect another massive issue to hit me. But guess what? There're constantly massive issues coming at you, and there's more coming, and that's the nature.
(49:39):
My friend, Michael Bell, is probably the best entrepreneur I know. He says, "There is no linear success." So what that means is that stock chart that you just referred to, there's no up-and-to-the-right perfect chart where it's just one line. I don't care who you are. Apple doesn't have one. No one has one. Okay? There's going to be changes. It could be economic changes. It could be societal changes. It could be the pandemic. There's no up-and-to-the-right. If you think it's only going to be about up and to the right, you're in the wrong business or you have the wrong life. Right? Hey, the monastic life is maybe more for you where you're just out living in that more of that steady state. Right? But if you want more variation where it's not steady state, the entrepreneurial life is a rock-and-roll roller coaster, and you get ready because it's going to be pounding you all the time.
Lenny Rachitsky (50:33):
One of these people that you described that jumped out of the airplane speaking on the roller coaster ride is your co-CEO, Bret Taylor. What's interesting to me is he's also all-in on agents, and what it makes me think about is there's this meme of what did Ilya see when he left and tried to kick out Sam Altman. I'm curious just like what did you guys see about agents being the future that you're both so committed to this? So interesting.
Marc Benioff (50:54):
Well, I just think that this idea that agents are one of the most important things that we're all going to work on, and I think everyone is going to go to agents. Look, I just heard about Google today has Agentspace. At first, I was like, "Well, I guess they like the Agentforce name." I love Sundar. He's one of my favorite people in the world. We heard Microsoft now has agents. I read Oracle has agents now. SAP has agents. Everybody's got agents, and good. That's what we want. We don't want to be the only one.
(51:30):
If you're the only one and no one else is working on it, you've got a problem, actually. So you don't want to be the only one. You want to be in a market. You don't want to be one company offering a solution and the only one. You want to be in a competitive market where people are competing with you, and you're selling against somebody else, and you're getting better, and you're moving forward. It's like the automobile industry. One of my favorite people is Akio Toyoda. Toyoda-san was now the Chairman of Toyota, was the CEO of Toyota. His grandfather started Toyota. He says, "Better, better, better. Never best." It's the Japanese motto of Kaizen.
(52:10):
So we talked about Japanese Shoshin, which means beginner's mind. Now, we're learning another Japanese word here, Kaizen. Kaizen is continuous improvement, and you need to be doing continuous improvement. With where we are right now with agents, every software industry is going to move to agents. We have to just like every software industry... Well, at least in CRM or automating customer touchpoints, data and managing data, and building that data infrastructure, agents. It's all related. We're all moving in the same direction.
Lenny Rachitsky (52:47):
I'm just thinking as a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"
Marc Benioff (52:54):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. That is the mindset you want. You want that mindset. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing." In some ways, you have to be saying, "I can't wait for the next failure. I can't wait for the next success. I can't wait for the next innovation." Oh, well, that's innovation overall, right?
(53:18):
See, we're in an industry where technology is constantly getting lower cost, easier to use, and more automated. So if you're doing for two and a half decades, or four decades, or four and a half decades now that I've been doing it... When I started in this industry, I started on a computer called the TRS-80 Model I with 4K of RAM. I was doing a podcast recently, and they're like, "Well, who did you sell your first piece of software to?" I said, "Well, I sold it to CLOAD Magazine in Goleta, California and-
Lenny Rachitsky (53:54):
For $75.
Marc Benioff (53:54):
For $75, and they said, "Thank you for..." and then they said, "Oh, that's great, and did you send them the disk?" I'm like, "No, no. There was no disk. CLOAD standard for Cassette Load in BASIC. That was the command in BASIC, C-L-O-A-D, Cassette Load, CLOAD. That was the command. So that was the name of their magazine, and then you would get the cassette every month with five or six things that they had bought from people like me." I mean, they didn't know they were buying it from a 15-year-old kid in high school in Burlingame High School California. But I had written the How to Juggle thing, and they bought it for $75. They sent me the one-page agreement, and I signed it. Then, I told my parents, and they're like, "What? Huh? You're doing what? Oh, okay. That's nice, honey. Great job."
(54:45):
So they didn't understand. Nobody knew. It was crazy. It was like 1979 or 1978, so nobody knew I was selling software. I was in high school. It was just a moment in time, but I need to have that mindset all the way along which is, "What is the next great thing? What is the next great success? What is the next great failure?" You're growing. You're evolving. You're learning from that. That's what you want. You want to have that growth mindset. Right? You want to embrace that. Does it make sense what I said?
Lenny Rachitsky (55:21):
Absolutely.
Marc Benioff (55:22):
I jumped on that one little thought. "Oh, gee, yeah. I've got this now under control, but now I've got agents, so now, what am I going to..." It's like, "No, that's what you want." By the way, I want what's after that too, and what's after that, and what's after that. That's what's really exciting about the future. It's coming.
Lenny Rachitsky (55:43):
Why?
Marc Benioff (55:43):
I want to be... One of our customers said this, and people think I said it. It wasn't me. I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there. That's what I think is... By the way, that's what I think Elon Musk does so well. He is like... I don't know all the crazy things he's doing to see the future. He's clearly doing some unusual things, but then he's like, "Yeah, we're going to have robots in the future, and brain machine interfaces, and driving electric cars. All of these things are going to be happening in the future, and I'm going to have 10 companies that are going to do all of them." Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:29):

Marc Benioff (56:29):
Never seen anything like it. I don't understand how it is even possible.

Same. Marc, I know you have to run. This was incredible. I think this is a beautiful place to end it.
