## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### I watched that in IMAX Theater in San Francisco, this insanely large screen and highly would recommend that. I don't think it's still out there. Yeah. [inaudible 01

29:30] ridiculous. Amazing. I think there's another one coming someday.
Naomi Gleit :
Oh yeah, yeah. Dune Three.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Dune Three. Just keep them coming. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?
Naomi Gleit :
Well, I'm going to check out that eye mask thing that you recommended, the WAOAW thing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's it.
Naomi Gleit :
I know it's super expensive, but have you tried the Eight Sleep?
Lenny Rachitsky :
I have. My wif...

### And I noticed that too. I think maybe they just released the latest edition. One of the features that is the killer feature for me is that it does a vibrating alarm so that when I wake up at 6

00 A.M., I do not wake up everyone in the house at 6:00 A.M., and so it's a thermal alarm. It makes the bed on my side hotter and it also slightly vibrates underneath my ear to wake me up.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's under your ear. I remember vibrating my whole part of the bed. I wonder if that's a new feature.
Naomi Gleit :
Maybe this is like... I'm on version three, maybe there's a version four. I don't know. Maybe that was version one.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, that's so funny. A nice thing about m...

**I watched that in IMAX Theater in San Francisco, this insanely large screen and highly would recommend that. I don't think it's still out there. Yeah. [inaudible 01**:

29:30] ridiculous. Amazing. I think there's another one coming someday.
Naomi Gleit :
Oh yeah, yeah. Dune Three.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Dune Three. Just keep them coming. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?
Naomi Gleit :
Well, I'm going to check out that eye mask thing that you recommended, the WAOAW thing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's it.
Naomi Gleit :
I know it's super expensive, but have you tried the Eight Sleep?
Lenny Rachitsky :
I have. My wife doesn't love it. She doesn't like the noise. It's like a very slight noise when it starts up, but it wakes her up, so we don't have it anymore.
Naomi Gleit :

**And I noticed that too. I think maybe they just released the latest edition. One of the features that is the killer feature for me is that it does a vibrating alarm so that when I wake up at 6**:

00 A.M., I do not wake up everyone in the house at 6:00 A.M., and so it's a thermal alarm. It makes the bed on my side hotter and it also slightly vibrates underneath my ear to wake me up.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's under your ear. I remember vibrating my whole part of the bed. I wonder if that's a new feature.
Naomi Gleit :
Maybe this is like... I'm on version three, maybe there's a version four. I don't know. Maybe that was version one.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, that's so funny. A nice thing about my life right now is that because I have no meetings or boss, I don't need an alarm.
Naomi Gleit :
That's awesome.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**However, it's amazing. However, we have a young kid and he wakes up at 6**:

00 to 6:30, so that's my alarm usually.
Naomi Gleit :
Oh, and then the other thing I wanted to mention, I don't know if you have this problem, but I'm trying to get a hundred grams of protein every day. I think a lot of my friends and I are focused on protein consumption right now, and so my trainer who helped me actually do the pull-ups and the push-ups started a protein products company called Promix that I really love, and he has this Rice Krispie treat thing that I usually eat every morning and gives me 15 grams of protein.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I just bought that.
Naomi Gleit :
What?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yes, I was reading, Kevin Rose had his favorite, his health stack, and I don't know if that's the brand, but it's exactly a Rice Krispie thing with 15 grams of protein. So I'm pretty sure that's it.
Naomi Gleit :
I'm pretty sure that's it, because the Rice Krispie part of it is very unique, so let me know what you think. I really like the chocolate chip flavor.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I hate them and I love them, so that's a really good tip. I just saw a funny TikTok where it's like I never thought when I'd grow up in be an adult, I'd be thinking so often about protein and how much protein I should be eating.
Naomi Gleit :
Maybe this is 40, I don't know. I'm not sure for me, but yes, I've been thinking a lot about protein. The other thing I really like is canned seafood, which has a lot of protein. So something called Fish Wife has, it's just Hipster, like Chicken of the Sea.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh yeah, they're very cute. Yes. My wife gets those. Another protein tip, they were a former sponsor, but no longer, but it's an amazing protein tip. Maui Nui venison beef sticks. It's 10 grams of protein and it's a delicious venison beef stick.
Naomi Gleit :
Thank you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There we go.
Naomi Gleit :
Look at what we've become Lenny.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just protein obsessed. It's just going to be so protein rich. Amazing. Okay, what else we got here? Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find helpful in working life?
Naomi Gleit :
Last month we were watching, or I guess two weeks ago, we were watching the US Open and we discovered that as people come through the hallway to come onto the court to play, the players all passed the Billie Jean King sign that says Pressure is Privilege. And I really loved that because I think just with the Teen Accounts launch and just a lot of the more public facing stuff that I have done recently, I do, like we talked about, get nervous, and I think Pressure is Privilege just reminds me that a lot of this stuff is a really incredible opportunity that I have and to be grateful for it. I can still be nervous, but also recognize and be grateful for it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that. Just to remind yourself that you're lucky to be feeling this pressure because that means something is important. Slightly different version of that is Zuck at the event in the Chase Center that you were also at had the shirt that said in Latin-
Naomi Gleit :
Learning through suffering.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Learning through suffering. Perfect.
Naomi Gleit :
Learning through suffering. I like that one too. I mean, I think he spoke a little bit about this being an entrepreneur is really, really hard.
Lenny Rachitsky :
They had the Jensen line about people asked him if he'd start Nvidia again, and his answer was like, "If I knew how insanely hard and stressful this was, I would not." Very, very honest. Okay. Last question. So Charles, your former colleague, told me that you're an incredible surfer-
Naomi Gleit :
Oh.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And that you design your life almost around where and when you can go surf.
Naomi Gleit :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Any story or lesson or I don't know, takeaway from surfing and the impact that's had on you? Lessons about surfing?
Naomi Gleit :
So I think surfing and life have a lot of parallels. It is an incredibly mental sport for me. The biggest thing that I can do to improve my surfing is to improve my confidence. And so when I'm going for a wave, a lot of times I will hesitate or pull back or. Instead, the best thing that you can actually do in that situation is stand up into your fear, is to ride the wave. That is the safest thing you can do. That is the thing that you're actually supposed to do, but on every dimension, that's the right thing. And so it's almost, I guess the motto there is stand up into the fear when you're going, you're about to catch a wave and actually the things that you can do when you're afraid, for example, like I said, pull back or throw your board are actually quite counterproductive and actually unsafe and could lead to more injury. And so it's just another reminder that you really need to commit. Stand up into your fear.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love it. Stand up into your fear and pressure is a privilege and learning through suffering. Naomi, this was so much fun. I'm so happy that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you a line? Where they find Naomi-isms, and anything else you want to point folks to and how can listeners be useful to you?
Naomi Gleit :
So believe it or not, I have Naomi.com. I know Boz has Boz.com. I bought that URL, I think maybe 20 years ago, 15 to 20 years ago from a farmer actually whose wife's name was Naomi rather, and his wife was not using it. And so I got it for quite a steal. And I'll just say that I've had other famous Naomis, much more famous and much more well known than I, who would like to have Naomi.com make offers for this URL. But I really like having just a home on the internet where I can put my Naomi-isms. They're also available on Instagram, Naomi Gleit.
:
How can listeners be useful to you? I think Lenny, I mentioned this before we got on the call, I don't tend to do that much public speaking or talking about Naomi-isms. I did some of it two years ago when we first launched but I, as a result of being on the podcast and stuff, would love to do more of this. And so I think any feedback on what listeners would like to see or hear from me, questions that would give me a reason where I felt like it would be useful for me to do more on Naomi-isms would be super helpful.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Sweet. So if you have any of those, leave them in the YouTube comments is usually the easiest place for folks to leave that. Naomi, thank you so much for being here. This was so much fun.
Naomi Gleit :
Thank you, Lenny.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bye everyone.
