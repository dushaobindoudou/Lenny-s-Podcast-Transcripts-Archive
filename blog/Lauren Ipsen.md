## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### I want to talk about what recruiters often do wrong and what you've learned there. But before we get there, one last question

do you have any tips for a product manager in the interviewing process, how to be more successful interviewing?
Lauren Ipsen :
I've had this come up a few times when I've interviewed product folks that they'll speak down on their counterparts or say that the reason they weren't able to meet deadlines or push product in the right way was because of the engineering team or because of other components of the business and it wasn't them. And so I think that's never a good way to go about it. So it s...

**I want to talk about what recruiters often do wrong and what you've learned there. But before we get there, one last question**:

do you have any tips for a product manager in the interviewing process, how to be more successful interviewing?
Lauren Ipsen :
I've had this come up a few times when I've interviewed product folks that they'll speak down on their counterparts or say that the reason they weren't able to meet deadlines or push product in the right way was because of the engineering team or because of other components of the business and it wasn't them. And so I think that's never a good way to go about it. So it seems obvious, but you would be surprised how not obvious it is.
Lauren Ipsen :
So thinking about things more holistically, speaking honestly about your strengths and things that you want to continue to grow and improve upon, and then being able to tell your story, like practice telling your story. So often people don't do that, especially when they're not looking for jobs, and then it's not until their 10th interview that they know how to tell their story and what they did and what they impacted and why they were someone to be missed when they moved on. Those are things that you want to know how to speak to, and unless it's something you've been doing or practicing, it's less natural. That's some advice I think just off the top of the head.
Lenny :
Awesome. That's really good advice. One thing that makes me think about, I know I want to get to this last section, but do you think the best product leaders have their kind of story figured out in the future and work backwards from that and have a sense of where they want to end up, or just kind of take it as it goes? Because I'm the latter. I had no plan, I just went to see ... follow the path that was presented. Do you think that is generally true for folks that end up being successful, or do you recommend people think about, "Here's where I want to be in five years, here's what I need to do to get there"? Do you have any guidance there?
Lauren Ipsen :
I mean, for what it's worth, I'm definitely more with you. I don't know where I want to be in five years, so it's tough for me to say. But I do think that typically someone that has the end goal of being a CEO will put the pieces into place to try and get there, and so it's not a bad idea if you do have an end goal of wanting to run your own thing to inch towards that. So maybe you go from being a product specific leader to then operating in some type of GM of a business unit capacity and owning a P&L, and then although it's more of a product oriented role, you're still getting closer and closer to that end goal of COO or CEO.
Lauren Ipsen :
So if it's something like that, then I think that naturally makes sense. Do think people can be enticed by shiny objects, so excited because it's a step up from a title perspective and things like that, and I think that's just so not important in the grand scheme of things. You could be the VP of product or a CPO of what, you know? That's so vague. If someone just says, "I want to be a chief product officer, that's the end goal," I always say, "Of what?" You could be the chief product officer of your household. Is it of a multi-billion dollar consumer brand or ...
Lauren Ipsen :
So I guess what I'm trying to say is work backwards from a goal for sure, but don't allow titles or valuation bubbles or other things to derail something that feels good. If you're in a role and you feel like you're making an impact and you're learning and you're growing and are excited about the work you're doing, do not allow a title of some other company to make you feel like what you're doing isn't worthwhile.
Lenny :
I love that advice. So many people just chase some fancy new role, new title, new logo, and end up getting there like, "Man, this sucks."
Lauren Ipsen :
Exactly. Yeah.
Lenny :
This reminds me, I did a meditation retreat once and one of the teachings there was you don't want to be fixated with achieving a specific thing, but you want to push your cart in that direction, just like head that direction and have a general sense, but not, "I need to be that thing and that's what'll make me happy."
Lauren Ipsen :
Exactly. I think that's exactly right.
Lenny :
Awesome. Okay. Final topic is from the recruiter perspective, what do you find recruiters do wrong most often or miss when they're trying to attract great product talent to a company?
Lauren Ipsen :
Yeah, so this is one I feel especially passionate about because I do think recruiters have a bit of a reputation, and I think that it's for some good reason. There's naturally people that forget that these are human beings that we're dealing with every single day that have lives, have families, have careers, or ambitions outside of their career.
Lauren Ipsen :
So I think it's essential that you remember that this is another human being on the other end of things and that you should treat them with the same level of respect that you would expect to be treated.
Lauren Ipsen :
This has become even more apparent now that I have gone through some of my own recruiting cycles where I was looking for different jobs, and a transactional recruiting call just will rub you so the wrong way and will make you want to put things on your resume like I just alluded to that say things like, "Whatever at Reddit," or what have you because you just don't want to deal with it.
Lauren Ipsen :
And so I think you have to be a human, you have to start with a relationship, find common ground, build rapport, listen to people, like actually listen, and remember what they say. So if someone says, "I never want to do a crypto company," and I just am only shoving crypto companies down their throat, that's just insanely tone deaf. Or if they say, "I have this vest that I really want to be around for in May of next year," and I just keep hitting them up prior to that, that's just so not receptive to what they just said.
Lauren Ipsen :
Things like that, make notes if easier, because we speak to so many people all day long so it's definitely not easy to do. But I'll have a note on my calendar that John Kim's vest just happened in March, and then I'll be like, "Oh, okay, might be a good time for me to catch up." I won't say, "Congrats on the recent vest." I'll say, "You want to grab a coffee, or do you want to catch up about this?" Or, "Hey, I saw that you were speaking at this conference, love what you spoke about with regards to this." You got to find ways to connect with people outside of just shoving them into a job.
Lauren Ipsen :
And so I would say something that I've learned and become very good at is starting with a foundation of relationship building, gaining trust from people, because once you have that, then people will hear you out on jobs and people will listen to you and actually trust your advice from a career direction and perspective, but that takes time to build that, and it's definitely not going to be built by just chucking things at the wall and seeing what sticks with people and seeing where you can shove them temporarily. In fact, that will make them lose trust. And once you lose trust in a candidate, it's impossible to get it back.
Lenny :
It's interesting how one of the recurring themes of our chat so far is just play the long game in every way, which takes more time.
Lauren Ipsen :
Yes.
Lenny :
Kind of sucks that you have to put in all this time ahead of time before you really need to get something done, but what you keep coming back to is just that's how you end up being successful as a recruiter, as a product leader, as a hiring manager, as a founder.
Lauren Ipsen :
A million percent. Yeah. Yeah. And it's really easy when you've got a quota to hit and you've got people to provide for and a mortgage to just think about the numbers, but you have to play the long game because people aren't just a commodity. It's so much more.
Lenny :
And one of the perks of working with a recruiter is they have done that already for you, and so I was going to ask, when does it make sense for a founder to engage with a recruiter like yourself and when should they not?
Lauren Ipsen :
Engaging with recruiters sooner rather than later in a proactive way is always a positive thing. It's just sometimes companies aren't at the stage where they can necessarily hire a full-time recruiter because of resources and how expensive it is to bring in an exec recruiter.
Lauren Ipsen :
So having someone that you can bounce things off of in a more informal capacity, bringing in someone like a talent advisor that can help in a consultative way, those types of things, a million percent. Leaning into the venture firms that have backed you, which is a lot of what I'm doing right now, that is definitely areas in which early CEO founders should be leaning into that and trying to get as knowledgeable as possible. And then I would say typically series B feels ... series A, dependent on the check size, and then series B feels like a good time to bring in a couple key big players, if the company's well positioned to do so.
Lenny :
And bring in meaning full-time in-house recruiters or a firm?
Lauren Ipsen :
Probably bring in a firm. Yeah. That would be my recommendation. I think you can bring in one or two recruiters in the early days like seed, if it makes sense for the company and they're growing quickly, but it's all kind of case to case.
Lenny :
The fact that you're kind of off the table for most founders now that you're at GC, which is a part ... And is that true? Like you basically at this point work for General Catalyst founders, is that correct?
Lauren Ipsen :
I am supporting all of our GC founders in the consumer and crypto portfolio. That being said, I spend all day every single day networking and chatting with amazing entrepreneurs, people that could be founding a company down the road and need some advice, great people that want to help in an advising capacity. So it is, I would say, 50% networking, 50% actual parachuting into portfolio.
Lenny :
Got it. Okay.
Lauren Ipsen :
Supporting them.
Lenny :
That's cool. I didn't know that part.
Lauren Ipsen :
Yeah.
Lenny :
So outside of that, what do you suggest founders look for when they're looking for a recruiter, and the second to last question, what are signs that this is a good firm, a good recruiter? Just what should you be looking for when you're looking to hire a recruiter, either in house or a firm?
Lauren Ipsen :
I think it's important to provide them with some direction and then see if they can recite it back to you. Tell them the types of things you're looking for and then say, "Did that resonate? Because I'd love to hear from you what you took away from that and what you think we should be looking for."
Lauren Ipsen :
And then kind of off the bat, ask them for a couple candidate ideas. Don't give them time to just go call other people. In real time, ask them for some candidate ideas. Where does their brain go? Who are people they would call tomorrow on this? The more that you can get that dynamic relationship formed before you even go to search, the more you can determine whether this is someone you want to calibrate with.
Lauren Ipsen :
So yeah, I think just putting them on the spot a little bit and asking them to show their work rather than just sending over a deck of searches that could have been done by other partners or could have just been done by other people on their team. You want to actually understand who this person is. So that first question is testing their listening skills and their ability to actually hear what you're saying and what you're looking for, and then the second is, okay, now how quickly can we get calibrated on what this profile should look like.
Lenny :
Awesome. That is great advice. Very tactical. Any final words or wisdom before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Lauren Ipsen :
This has been awesome, by the way. I think more generally, the advice is just treat people like human beings, build rapport, play the long game, and gain trust, and that takes time. And so those are the most important things from a recruiting standpoint, is being able to tap people and have them feel like you genuinely have their best interest at heart and that you care about their career and life outside their career. And so I think that's what makes for a really good recruiter.
Lenny :
Simple advice, but often forgotten and easy to overlook. Awesome. All right. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to give you six questions, whatever comes to mind, we'll go through them real fast. Does that sound good?
Lauren Ipsen :
Okay. Yes. Let's do it.
Lenny :
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?
Lauren Ipsen :
The Power of Now and You Are Here.
Lenny :
Wow. Awesome. What are favorite other podcasts that you listen to other than this one?
Lauren Ipsen :
I mean, there's tech ones, but Your Own Backyard because I went to Cal Poly, so that one hits a little close to home.
Lenny :
Wow, I haven't heard of that. Cool. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've watched that you've enjoyed?
Lauren Ipsen :
Top Gun I've watched too many times and-
Lenny :
The new Top Gun.
Lauren Ipsen :
Yeah. And then TV show. Oh, it's all trash reality, so I just can't tell you.
Lenny :
I get that. I understand. My wife has that and she can't tell anyone. Yeah.
Lauren Ipsen :
That's my one secret.
Lenny :
All right. Okay, great. We'll move on, but that's great. What's a favorite ... Oh, this is interesting. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask or maybe you've seen someone ask?
Lauren Ipsen :
I love the good strengths and weaknesses question. I think it's really good to see how people self-analyze themselves.
Lenny :
What do you look for in their answer that's the sign that it's well answered?
Lauren Ipsen :
Honesty, authenticity. Can read right through a, "Work too hard," answer or a perfectionist type answer. What are your weaknesses? Let's talk about it.
Lenny :
For real.
Lauren Ipsen :
So that one I think is always a really good test of character.
Lenny :
What are some favorite apps right now?
Lauren Ipsen :
I've been playing around on BeReal. I mean, I love Spotify, it's straightforward. And then I've been on Strava, I've been running, so that are the-
Lenny :
That's a good combination of apps. That's like a full life.
Lauren Ipsen :
Thank you. Thanks so much. Trying to be.
Lenny :
Final question. Who else in the industry would you say that you most respect as a leader and a thought leader influence type person?
Lauren Ipsen :
My first boss out of college, Joe Suliman, is awesome. He's always taught me to lead with that relationship-based approach and it's really so easy to say that you do that, but then to actually do it and live it out for the people that work for you, as well as the people that are in industry and speak of you, is something else. And so he's always taught me to do that, and I just learned a ton from him and he's just incredibly smart and in tune with what's happening in industry and makes great stances and opinions on how to navigate those types of things. So, he's someone that I have an immense amount of respect for.
Lenny :
Sounds like an amazing person. Lauren, this was excellent. I feel like this is going to be useful to so many people, product managers, founders, other recruiters, all kinds of other people. Thank you so much for doing this and making the time. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or maybe collaborate with you and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Lauren Ipsen :
Yes, absolutely. And also, thank you. This has been so much fun. They can reach out to me on LinkedIn. I happen to be on that one quite a bit, so definitely can DM me there, can send me an email, and I can shoot you that over as well. And then the way they can be helpful is if there's people that they think the world of, shoot them my way. If they have questions around best ways to go through an interview process or how to navigate different things, please, by all means, a huge part of my job is trying to help people that are going through this for the first time. Happy to just be a sounding board or of help in any capacity.
Lenny :
So if you're an awesome product leader, you want to see what's out there, find Lauren on LinkedIn. Is that the best place to find you?
Lauren Ipsen :
That's perfect.
Lenny :
All right. Awesome.
Lauren Ipsen :
Yep.
Lenny :
