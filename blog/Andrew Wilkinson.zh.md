Andrew Wilkinson :
Something like that. In 2007, there was this device called the Palm Treo and it was like a little PDA with a stylus and it had a little modem attachment. And so what you could do is you could get your email anywhere and that was this shocking thing. It had a black and white or barely color screen and you could go in and email people. And I remember walking through the mall buying shoes while answering business emails and going, "This is the ultimate freedom. This is incredible." But the problem with that device was it sucked. You had to use a stylus, it's not a good user experience. And then the iPhone comes out and you're like, "Okay, this is what I was waiting for. This is the real thing." But I got a little preview with the Palm Treo and so right now people like me who have the time and skillset to nerd out and build the agents can do this. It's just not accessible to everybody.
:
And I think that if it was accessible to everybody in terms of if you could just open ChatGPT and say, "Hey, ChatGPT, I run a business, can you help me?" And it started asking you questions and it said, "Oh well you do sales. Do you want me to set up a sales agent? Okay, great, plug in your HubSpot API, now tell me a few things and then give me access to all your data." And then before you know it, it's just a digital employee that's on the other end of the phone on ChatGPT just like in the movie, Her, that you can talk to and it can go do stuff. I think that is kind of the iPhone moment that we're going to have in some time in the next five years. And so I think that if AI doesn't progress, we will see some serious job displacement, like what you already mentioned, the translators, the researchers, the admin, some assistant jobs, depending on the kind of work they do, those jobs will definitely be massively affected.
:
But I think pretty quick, all knowledge work jobs could be affected if the models scale in the way that they say they're going to. I mean if you trust Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, I mean Dario Amodei said by, "2027, our models will be smarter than all PhDs." So in any subject. That is a staggering statement. And he's been a very conservative kind of almost fearful voice in the AI world. Very cautious to say things like that. And so when he said that, I perked up and started listening carefully. I don't know that that's how it's going to play out. He might be trying to fundraise, we have to take it with a grain of salt. But if that's true, then I think so many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, there's a lot here. I actually had Mike on the podcast, their CPL, Mike Krieger, and he pointed out that Dario, every prediction he's had so far has been right over the past few years. And so there's a reason to listen to his insights. Okay. Andrew, I know you're not going to have all the answers for people. But let me ask you kind of a two-part question for new grads and for people currently in the workforce say like, I don't know, senior product manager advice on what they should do, where should they focus? What skills will matter most? What jobs do you think will last? What advice can you give us?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Everybody 10 years ago, do you remember there was this whole movement that we should teach kids how to code? Remember that?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Mh-hmm.
Andrew Wilkinson :
Now teaching kids how to code is teaching kids Basic and we have a GUI, right? You don't need to learn punch cards and basic programming or MS-DOS because we all have keyboards and mice. We don't have to do that. And I feel like coding has really gone away because of that. And I think now people are saying people need to learn how to prompt, which I think is very true for the tool set right now. But I don't know how relevant that is in the future because I think we're still, again, in the Palm Treo phase, I think that the AIs will be very good at eliciting what the actual problem you're trying to solve is and reinterpreting it in a way that it can optimize the query to get the right answer and solve the problem.
:
And so I think the fundamental question is do all jobs just become a single prompt? For example, does a CEO just grow the business while making the customers happy and turning a profit or something like that? And it is able to actually be an omniscient presence that can run a whole company. Now that's a big I'm someone building AI agents. I can barely get it to reliably do calendar entries and that kind of stuff. So I don't think that's totally imminent, but I can certainly see a world where that's coming. And so the question is, what is one to do when that reality is barreling down at you? For people who have resources, I think there's a lot of things they can do in terms of investment, they can invest in the companies that'll benefit from this, companies that have a lot of compute or energy or that sort of thing.
:
So that's one thing, but that's not really the question. The question is what do you do if you're a smart 18-year-old or 19-year-old or whatever? In my opinion, I think the best thing to do right now is to get incredibly good with these tools and utilize them to build enough wealth that you can put the money into diversifying into compute and energy. And I do think that while everybody thinks that all jobs will go away in five years and robots will be everywhere, people generally overestimate things in the short term and underestimate them in the long term. So I think there's going to be this long window where robotics is not anywhere near good enough to even do raking leaves and stuff. And I think there's going to be a ton of opportunity for people to just spin up new businesses that never existed before.
:
I was talking to some friends and we were like, "What do you do in a world of abundance where everything is really cheap and companies operate almost autonomously?" I think there's a lot of weird skillsets that we can't imagine right now. For example, just being funny, right? Being funny to hang out with them. Think about OnlyFans, right? Right now, there's this whole idea of OnlyFans where people are paying for comfort and connection, but in a romantic sense. Imagine people did that day to day, they just love hanging out with funny people. So you have a funny guy who you chat with or comes over to your house or whatever it is, I'm making stuff up. Maybe it's a guy who comes to play pickleball with you or something, I don't know. But I can imagine that in this weird world, there's all these weird new jobs.
:
So I think my take is things will either be totally fine or they will be terrible and we'll all be dead. And I can't predict which those is there. I don't think it's worth thinking about all of us being dead. And so I think it's really just lean into what are the tools, how do you stay cutting edge? How do you build businesses and wealth in this new world? But I am certainly feeling a little bit like all of our brains could be defunct in the next 10 years. And that's kind of a scary thought.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm picturing this dystopian world where humans are just going around making jokes.
Andrew Wilkinson :
Where does status come from in a world of abundance? Where does status come from? Maybe it is just like being the best at hiking or something.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Well, let me ask you this because this is where it gets even more real is just with your kids. What are you encouraging them to learn? What are you encouraging them to get good at? Because this is the real problem a lot of people are having right now is what will matter in the future. Obviously we don't know, but what are you encouraging them to focus on?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Well, I don't know. I mean there's so little, they're five and eight. And so really what I'm focused on is making sure they're socialized and they're polite, very basic. So are they comfortable talking to adults? I often send my son, whenever he wants something at a cafe, I always make him go up, ask nicely, pay himself, all that kind of stuff. But at this point I feel like for the first 10 years of life, you're just trying to make sure that they're not traumatized or rude. And I think it's going to be really interesting when they're 10 plus where they're really aware of this stuff and can start building with these tools. And to be honest, I just don't know. I think I just want them to lean into whatever they're passionate about and go from there. But I have no idea. And to be honest, it's not something I'm worrying about because it's too hard to worry about. I don't know, it's too multivariate. There's too many ways it can go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I feel like a core part of your message is just get good with these tools. There's this classic quote, "AI won't replace you, it'll be somebody very good using AI is going to replace you," at least for a while. And so it feels like a big part of this is just use these things. Before we started recording, we were having a mic issue and I love you just went straight to ChatGPT, "ChatGPT, how do I connect this mic to reverse side and make it work?" And I feel like that's just a habit to build is just like go to ChatGPT whenever you have a problem like that. I've been doing that a lot. I was connecting a subwoofer from what wire do I need to buy to connect the subwoofer to the receiver?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Well, the best part about ChatGPT is I used to just get stuck and I have ADHD. So when I got stuck, let's say, what's an example? I was redoing my home IT security. And what will happen is I'll be in the terminal and I'll enter something and then something goes wrong and it just keeps erroring. And then I'm like, "Well, I'm out." I have ADHD, I can't tolerate this. I just lose the thread completely. And ChatGPT allows me to stay on track and go so much further and faster than I ever could before. I love not being artificially stopped in your tracks and being able to continue the flow state as a result.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And also I noticed you were using voice mode, which is what I've been using more and more. And I feel like that's something a lot of people sleep on is just the voice mode where you could talk to it and not have to sit there and type your questions. Okay, so let me go in a different direction. You've been spending a lot of time, you wrote a whole book about this, of just your journey from, you call it Barista to Billionaire where you started serving coffee, then you ended up being very successful, then realize that didn't make you happy. You're quite unhappy with lots and lots of money. I think a lot of people hear these stories, they see this stuff, they're like, "Yeah, okay, I sort of get it." But they still do the same sorts of things. They still assume they will be happy once they reach that next goal, that next title, make certain dollar amount. What can you share? What have you learned about just what it actually takes to be happy that you think people are still not really recognizing and still kind of are confused about?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Do you remember when you're in your early 20s? I remember when I was in my early 20s, I'd always be like, "I need to move away to Europe. I need to go discover myself." And I'd be really anxious and stressed out and in an existential crisis and then I'd fly to Europe to go backpacking or something and I'd still feel anxious and have my existential crisis. It's just now I'm in Europe. And I think the reality is that whatever's in your brain, whatever that anxiety loop is, doesn't go away just because you have a bigger house or more money in the bank account or you're in Bali or wherever it is, that's a chemical reaction happening inside you that relates to your past and your DNA and all that stuff that creates that soup. And for me, I've always been a very anxious person. I've always worried about tomorrow, I rarely enjoy today, I'm always worrying about what could go wrong in health or my businesses or with my family or whatever it is.
:
And so when I started my business, all I thought was I just don't want to work for someone else. If I can just wake up in the morning, do my own thing, make 60K a year, then I'll be happy. So I got that and then it was once I make a million dollars a year and I can buy a house, well, I got that and so on and so on and so on all the way up to at one point being worth over a billion dollars, by the way, should redo the title of the book from Barista to Billionaire, now it's former billionaire because our stock went down, but it didn't change anything. I'm still just as anxious as ever. I remember a month ago, I had this day where I was sitting in the sauna and I was stressing about a bunch of business problems and money things and I stopped myself and I was like, "Wait a minute."
:
10 years ago I had all the same thoughts and I was stressed out about similar kinds of problems and our revenue was $20 million bucks or $15 million bucks. Now we're at almost 300 million and I'm still stressed about the same things. And the saddest part was as I met more and more wealthier people all the way up to multibillionaires, I realized they were all still comparing themselves to their peers, competing over who has what and tracking stuff and still unhappy that anxiety loop or depression was still in their brain. I remember I had this moment where I met this guy who is a single-digit multibillionaire, and he goes, "Oh, Jeff Bezos, he's just so fucking rich." And I was like, "Wait, what do you mean you're worth $5 billion? What can he do that you can't?" And he goes, "He can buy a super yacht." And it's like, "What?"
:
You can look at that guy and you can say, "Oh, that's a wacko and all the other stuff." But the reality is that we're all just comparing ourselves to our peers, whatever our peers have that we don't feel hard done by. And I remember just thinking like, "Oh my God, how do I avoid becoming this?" And that's the scary reality is no matter how lucky you are, I mean we're also fortunate. For me, I live in Canada. I have every opportunity that I ever could have hoped for. And there's people all over the world who have nowhere near what I had growing up. And yet I felt hard done by because in my neighborhood I was the poor kid. I wasn't poor globally. I wasn't even poor based on Canada. But all my friends had big screen TVs and would go to Hawaii and I never got to do any of that stuff. My parents were stressed about money. So I feel hard done by.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There's a phrase of friend's financial advisor once shared, "The Joneses are doing really well," and that's hard to get over. So what changes did you make to just be happier? It's hard to give up money. It's hard to give up more money you could make. It's hard to give up things that money buys, I guess just so what did you change?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Well, there's a few things. I mean, one was reframing money to some degree to have it be something that wasn't just about feathering my own nest and making it better. So for example, I was talking to a friend who's very wealthy and I was saying all the feelings I described of have all this and yet I don't feel better. And he said, "Well, what are you working for?" And I said, "Well, I guess I'm just working for the numbers to get bigger and have more employees and that's nice. Our businesses do good things in the world and help more people and stuff, but ultimately it's just to pile up cash." And he said, "I've reframed it so that all my money, 90% of my money plus, goes into my philanthropic foundation and then it gets given away to great causes. So when I think about working really hard or losing a deal or an investment going well, the win isn't for me. The win is about doing something good."
:
So I did that and that definitely helped. I also stopped spending as much money. I found that the more stuff I had, the more houses I had, the more people that directly worked for me to manage all that stuff, the less happy, I was owned by my stuff. And then I work really hard not to have people... I try not to beat people over the head with it. I drive a normal car. I don't bring people to my house until I know them really, really well. I meet them on neutral ground, I meet them in a cafe. I dress like a schmo. I just try not to be a weird out of touch rich person. But the biggest thing, which is a weird answer, is actually medicating myself. So basically all my life I've been really anxious.
:
And in 2020, I remember I was watching a movie with my ex-wife and I was looping on, "I need to respond to this email. If I don't respond to that email, this person's going to be mad." And then I realized that I was watching a movie for the last 20 minutes and I didn't know anything about what was happening in the movie. And then I was going, "Oh my God, my wife is going to be mad at me. We're going to get in a fight," and I'm projecting all this negative stuff. And in that moment I was like, "Okay, maybe I do need to try an SSRI or something. This is not sustainable." And so I went to my doctor and I got prescribed with one, and I remember I was so scared of it that I cut it into 10 pieces. I said, "I'm just going to take a tiny little piece."
:
And it took me six months after that to try any. But I started taking these pieces every day and I just noticed that within about three or four days, it was like someone had turned down the volume on the nasty voice inside of me doing all that. And for the first time in my life I felt relief. No amount of money or success or attention or anything else had done what this little tiny yellow pill could do for my mental state. And so now I've been on an SSRI for four and a half years or something like that. And then I also started medicating my ADHD. And I would say that my brain went from Times Square to a quiet library. And I think a lot of people are scared of that, but ultimately most people are acting out something that's going on inside of them. There's a trauma or something medically going on and that's creating this anxiety, this depression, this feeling and addressing that is so much more important than trying to get praise from the external world.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow, it's really powerful. I really am really thankful you're sharing this. The advice most people hear, the general, I don't know, culture is just like, "No, don't take meds. Don't medicate yourself, I don't know, there's all these downsides, all this risk. The pharma industry is trying to make money." I love this other perspective of it. It's actually really effective and actually makes a big difference in your life and it may be the only solution.
Andrew Wilkinson :
Well, it's funny because if you have a headache, I don't think many people say, "Oh, don't take Tylenol, you're benefiting Johnson & Johnson, big pharma." They go, "Yeah, you take a Tylenol when you have a headache." Or a lot of people have seasonal allergies and they take antihistamines and they forget that histamine is not just in your nose, histamines in your brain and everywhere in your body. And so when you take an antihistamine or even a Tylenol, you're changing your brain, you're changing the way you think, you're changing everything. And yet for some reason, people are so scared, myself included, of taking an SSRI or similar medication to treat something that is ruining their life. Anxiety was ruining my life. Every minute of every day I was convinced that something terrible was about to happen. And even now medicated, I still have that voice. It's not like that frankly beneficial voice that helps you grow your business or whatever becomes unproductive at a certain point. And I think that it is wonderful to be able to actually just get a little bit of solace from it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Well, for folks that, I mentioned many folks listening, are like, "Oh man, I should really explore this," what's the best way to explore is to talk to your primary care physician?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Yeah. I think talking to your doctor, and one note I think a lot of people miss is when I was so scared of side effects because you hear about all these horrific side effects of people lose their libido and feel terrible and stuff. And so I looked into it and a lot of the side effects are due to the way that people metabolize different drugs. And so you can actually do your 23andMe or similar DNA test and you can find out how you metabolize different SSRIs. And then I chose one that I could metabolize well. And so I've had no side effects or problems. And I know every time I mention this, I get a lot of people that say exactly what you say, big pharma and all this other stuff. But I just ask everyone listening, if you take a Tylenol or you take an antihistamine or other medications, I don't know why something that can be so profoundly helpful is something that people need to be afraid of.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Andrew, we've covered so much ground. I love the spectrum of topics we've gone after. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything you wanted to double down on? Any last nugget you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Andrew Wilkinson :
One thing that was shocking for me was I was doing... My doctor asked me to get a cognitive test, not because I had any problem, but he said, "Look, it's really important to get a baseline in your 30s because then as you age, we can make sure that you're not getting Alzheimer's or dementia or whatever." So I go and I do this test with a neurologist and she asked me a bunch of questions. It's, "Remember these 10 digits and say them backwards and all this stuff." And finally when I get my test results back, she said, "Look, your crystallized intelligence, your ability to remember stuff, long range is totally fine. You're above average. Your short-term memory, your working memory is 10th percentile, very, very bad. And you probably should get checked for ADHD."
:
And I was like, "Nope. There's no way. I don't have ADHD. I'm organized. I've got to-do lists. I built a business. I wasn't the hyper kid in school or anything like that." And she said, "Well, look, just humor me. Just go get tested." And so I went through this crazy process. You can go online and just quickly get tested or whatever. But I went through this really, really five-day process to get tested. And it turned out that I do have it. And it's really interesting because if you take the normal population of about 5% of people have ADHD, but about 30% of entrepreneurs have ADHD. And many entrepreneurs I talk to, they love new things. They love jumping around between a million different topics. They're an inch deep and a mile wide like I described. And they describe themselves as unemployable. And frankly, I remember I was so skeptical of ADHD that when my girlfriend told me, a friend of hers got diagnosed with it, I sarcastically said, "Oh good, she better take some meth," talking about stimulant drugs.
:
Previously I was very, very skeptical of ADHD, but it is a real brain disorder if you actually dig into it. It's a very real thing, very objective that people have poor executive function. And for me, it's given me a lot more empathy for myself and my behaviors because at work, if you have ADHD, you can delegate to other people and build systems to get around your disability. But at home, that's where it really plays out. And so for me, it's like my girlfriend asked me to take the garbage out, and I say, "Of course." And then I forget three times in a row. And she views that as you are being very hurtful and you're not caring for me. And it causes all sorts of different problems at home.
:
And so for me, not only did it make my work life better because I was more focused, but it actually really helped me in my personal life and it made me feel not broken. I always felt a bit broken. I couldn't put my finger on why, but I just went, "I'm not good at doing all the things everyone else seems to be able to do no problem." And so I think especially because you have an entrepreneur audience, I think a lot of entrepreneurs should consider getting checked for ADHD. Just go and ChatGPT say, "Ask me a of questions and tell me if you think I might have it." But I was very surprised, and that's been really impactful for me too.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Man, this garbage story is very descriptive of my life, and so I'm going to do this. There's this implication that it's good to know this, right? It feels scary to feel like, "Oh, shit I might get diagnosed with ADHD." Your advice I imagine is it's better to know because you could do stuff about it.
Andrew Wilkinson :
Totally. I think it's like any medical thing, right? It's like there's an Alzheimer's gene, right? And if you know you have it, there's a lot you can do to slow the disease or prevent maybe getting it or whatever. It's always better to know. Even if you don't medicate, I think there's a lot of lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, and just things you can do to make your life easier, even if it's just explaining to your partner, "Hey, I need things to be explained to me this way so that I can be effective in loving you."
Lenny Rachitsky :
Beautiful. Okay. Well, Andrew, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Let's go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
Andrew Wilkinson :
If I could only recommend two, I would recommend The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene. It's basically like a compendium of every single type of personality disorder or psychological effect. How do people work their minds to make bad decisions? What is a narcissist? What is a psychopath? All that kind of stuff. And Robert Greene does such a great job of telling all that in a really engaging way by using storytelling. So every single chapter has a story about someone with that personality disorder. So I love that book.
:
The other one that I love is a book by Felix Dennis called How to Get Rich. It's hilarious because the whole book starts out saying, "I got rich and I regret it, and I wish that I'd become a poet." And instead he went off and he built this huge publishing empire, became a poet in his sixties, and then he died of throat cancer. So it's his story, he basically says, "I'll tell you how to build the business even though you probably shouldn't." And I read that when I was in my 20s, and I found it so exciting and inspiring, and then I recently reread it and I was like, "Oh my God, why didn't I listen to this guy?" Everything he said came true.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?
Andrew Wilkinson :
I love Challengers. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's amazingly acted, amazing cinematography. It's like this amazing romantic triad tennis movie. Really, really good.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love? You already mentioned Limitless. Is there anything else?
Andrew Wilkinson :
I'm one of those people who really believes in the idea of a robot vacuum. I've probably spent $10,000 on different robot vacuums over the years, probably five or six of them. And I finally got one that actually works. It's called the Matic Vacuum, M-A-T-I-C. And basically, I think it's like former Google Engineers basically built like a mini Waymo car. So it has machine vision and it will avoid absolutely everything and never get tangled, and it can mop your floors and vacuum. I've been super impressed with it so far.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I've got one of these myself. Completely agree. My wife loves it, which I did not expect. She's like, "Turn that Matic on." It's very delightful. It has his little personality and it just does a really good job. And I'm not an investor, and that's awesome. I'm a huge fan. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Yeah. My favorite is a quote by Jerzy Gregorek. It's, "Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life." And I often find that anytime that I'm making the easy choice, my life gets hard. And when I make the hard choice to shut down the business, fire the person, say bye to a project that I was excited about, it's almost always the right choice and it makes my life a lot easier.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Final question. Okay, so let me know if this is true. I found that when you were a teenager, when you're running Macteens, you interviewed Steve Jobs at a conference. Is that true?
Andrew Wilkinson :
So when I was a teenager, I had a tech news website and I emailed the Apple PR people and I said, "Hey, could I interview Steve Jobs?" And they kind of laughed at me. They're like, "Yeah, there's no way. You're not going to interview Steve Jobs, but hey, why don't you go to this tour of the Apple Store?" So this is no other Apple Store has existed. This is in New York at Macworld back in 2004, no, 2003, something like that. And so I was really excited about that. So I show up to go do this tour and there's 30 other journalists there, and I'm first in line, and this big black SUV pulls up and this man gets out and the man is wearing gray New Balance, little circular John Lennon glasses, the mock turtleneck. And my brain finally puts it together and I realize it's Steve Jobs.
:
And he walks directly up to me because I'm first in line and he shakes my hand and he says, "Hi, I'm Steve." And I'm like a quivering mess. I'm 17 years old. He is my hero. He's my Jesus. And so I was just so high on adrenaline that I just started asking him questions. As soon as we walked in, I basically just stayed at his side, and I just picked his brain about all sorts of different stuff. So it's not like I got to ask him questions about life. I was asking him about the new 17-inch iMac or whatever. But it was a pretty cool experience to get to meet him.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That is awesome. There's such a funny thread recently with guests. Everyone, there's like a Steve Jobs connection for the past couple months of guests. That's an awesome story. It just shows that it wasn't luck. You made this happen. You got there first in line.
Andrew Wilkinson :
The lesson for me was ask big and maybe you'll get something great. Ask for amazing, you'll get something great, which I did.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yes, door in the face technique, I think people call it.
Andrew Wilkinson :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Andrew, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out? I know you're buying companies, investing in companies. Just talk about what you're looking for there in case people are like, "Oh, this is me." And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?
Andrew Wilkinson :
Yeah, my business is Tiny, T-I-N-Y.com, and we buy businesses. Basically, when we sold the business, we hated it. We went through this process where we talked to all these douchebags that ran private equity firms that would show up in our office in suits and use a bunch of words we didn't understand. And we ended up going, "Man, why can't we just sell to somebody who's like us?" And so we basically started Tiny to become the buyer we wish we could have sold to. And we're looking for businesses that have some of the qualities I mentioned before. So really high quality businesses that do something positive in the world and have happy customers, happy employees, and some kind of competitive advantage that will make them continue into the future. So we own AeroPress, Letterboxd, Dribble, which is a design social network, whole bunch of businesses like that. So if somebody is thinking about selling their business, definitely get in touch.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Okay. And then how can listeners be useful to you if it's not just that?
Andrew Wilkinson :
I just would say if there's anyone really interesting coming to Victoria, Canada, which is where I live, send me an email and would love to have coffee with you. The reason I love going on podcasts is because I get to meet so many interesting people, both randomly. If I'm in a cafe and someone sees me and says hi, I often make a lot of friends that way, or if someone comes to my hometown. So yeah, just get in touch.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Andrew, thank you so much for being here.
Andrew Wilkinson :
Yeah, thanks, dude. That was fun.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bye, everyone.
