## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### Let me tell you about a product called Arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished on-brand demos in minutes. Telling the story of your product is hard, and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why product four teams such as Atlassian, [inaudible 00

39:49], and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails, and documentation.
:
But don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a 2x higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos. On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before.
:
Creating a product demo has never...

### Well, my team had built all this technology. We had test drive working. It was kind of a hard piece of technology if you think about simulating any of thousands of arbitrary apps. And we worked all night to launch it, and it wasn't quite working at 6

00 AM. We were still debugging.
:
Now you know engineers very well. And I'm sure most of your listeners know about engineers, even if that's not their discipline. We always think we're this close to finding the last bug.
:

### So about 6

15 AM, I get a message from Jeff that says, "Hey, I woke up, where's the letter?" Because it was supposed to go live at 6:00 AM, right after the markets in New York would've opened at 9:00 AM Eastern. And he says, "Where's the letter?" And I write him back and I say, "Well, we're working on a few problems." And what I'm thinking in my head is, "Get in the shower, get in the shower. I just need 20 minutes, get in the shower."
Lenny :
For Jeff to get in the shower.
Ethan Evans :
Yeah. And 30 secon...

### And he starts copying in my boss, and my boss's boss who's with Jeff Wilke, the CEO of retail. And they start asking me questions. And it's just this snowballing, but 7

30 in the morning, Jeff is clearly angry. And there's this list of other people waking up and feeling like, "Well Jeff is angry, so my job is to be even more angry," and it's just raining in on me.
Lenny :
Oh man.
Ethan Evans :
So what did I do? The interesting thing is what do you do when the future richest man in the world is mad at you? He wasn't quite richest man in the world yet, but he was headed there.
:

### So the first thing I did was I owned it. I said, "Yes, it's not working. It's my fault. I will deal with it." I took ownership. And the second thing I did was start updating him very proactively and saying, "Here's where we are." 8

00 AM, "This is exactly where we are. This is what we're going to do and the next hour, and this is when you'll get your next update. I will update you again at 9:00 AM, so here's our plan."
:

### And even though Jeff had sort of lost trust in me, like it's down, and it's not right, and I'm mad, given that he agreed with the plan, he was willing to give me 60 minutes. And then I would update him again and say, "Okay, this is what we've done and this is what we're going to do, and we'll update you again at 10

00 AM." So I was buying life one hour at a time.
:
Now the other thing I did, and this is a good thing about Amazon, as more and more leaders got copied into this angry thread, they started reaching out in back channel and saying, "We've all been under Jeff's Eye of Sauron, we know it's miserable. What can we do to help?" And essentially Andy Jassy's organization, which was AWS at that time, and his CTO, a guy named Werner Vogels said, "You're having a database problem, let's get you some princi...

### And these principal engineers showed up at 9

00 AM roughly, and they looked at our design. We had made some fundamental mistakes in our database usage and they said, "It's too complicated to fix this. We're just going to give you 500 AWS machines so that your crappy design will run anyway. That's the immediate fix." And I'm like, "Okay, well I guess if you have 500 databases lying around because you're AWS, it's a great solution," and that's what they did.
:
So the next step is we fixed the problem. A bunch of us worked together very hard ...

### And he found a problem and emailed me like Saturday night at 9

00 like, "I was doing this and it broke." And luckily I was able to tell him exactly what happened by 9:30. Anyway, the next part of the story is that following week, I had a meeting with him on another topic.
:
So I was part of this small group that was trying to figure out how to build a competing browser. You may not remember, but Amazon had a browser called Silk for a while. And I was invited to this meeting, but I wasn't a critical participant. So you may know this idea from Scrum where the...

:
Now let's take a little trip to failure corner. This is something that I do more and more on this podcast, talk about people's failures in their career and their learnings. And apparently you have a great story of failing the great Jeff Bezos and surviving to tell the tale. Could you share that story?
Ethan Evans :
I do. It's both a highlight and a low light. So I had been at Amazon about six years. I had become a director, and I was responsible for launching Amazon's app store.
:
And so we were building an Android-based app store to go on Google phones and eventually on the Kindle tablets. And we got to launch day. And at that time, Jeff used to write a letter introducing new products. He would write a letter that said, "Dear customers, today Amazon's proud to launch blah blah, blah, and it's got these great features and I hope you really enjoy it. Thanks Jeff." And we would take down all the sales stuff on www.amazon.com and that letter would fill the whole screen.
:
And so he had written a Jeff letter, and this Jeff letter emphasized a particular feature of our product that he really liked. So that something that made it a little different.
:
And that specific thing was we had a button called test drive that you could click on and it would open the app in a simulator in your web browser, so you could check out the app and interact with it before putting it on your phone. So he thought this was really cool and he was all about it.
:

**Well, my team had built all this technology. We had test drive working. It was kind of a hard piece of technology if you think about simulating any of thousands of arbitrary apps. And we worked all night to launch it, and it wasn't quite working at 6**:

00 AM. We were still debugging.
:
Now you know engineers very well. And I'm sure most of your listeners know about engineers, even if that's not their discipline. We always think we're this close to finding the last bug.
:

**So about 6**:

15 AM, I get a message from Jeff that says, "Hey, I woke up, where's the letter?" Because it was supposed to go live at 6:00 AM, right after the markets in New York would've opened at 9:00 AM Eastern. And he says, "Where's the letter?" And I write him back and I say, "Well, we're working on a few problems." And what I'm thinking in my head is, "Get in the shower, get in the shower. I just need 20 minutes, get in the shower."
Lenny :
For Jeff to get in the shower.
Ethan Evans :
Yeah. And 30 seconds later, I have an email back that says, "What problems?" And at this point I have to start explaining, and I end up explaining that we're having a problem with a database, and we're debugging this database problem. And he's like, "Wait, there's a database in your design? We're trying to eliminate all Oracle databases and move to AWS. Why do you even have this?" And he is just getting more and more frustrated and angry.
:

**And he starts copying in my boss, and my boss's boss who's with Jeff Wilke, the CEO of retail. And they start asking me questions. And it's just this snowballing, but 7**:

30 in the morning, Jeff is clearly angry. And there's this list of other people waking up and feeling like, "Well Jeff is angry, so my job is to be even more angry," and it's just raining in on me.
Lenny :
Oh man.
Ethan Evans :
So what did I do? The interesting thing is what do you do when the future richest man in the world is mad at you? He wasn't quite richest man in the world yet, but he was headed there.
:

**So the first thing I did was I owned it. I said, "Yes, it's not working. It's my fault. I will deal with it." I took ownership. And the second thing I did was start updating him very proactively and saying, "Here's where we are." 8**:

00 AM, "This is exactly where we are. This is what we're going to do and the next hour, and this is when you'll get your next update. I will update you again at 9:00 AM, so here's our plan."
:

**And even though Jeff had sort of lost trust in me, like it's down, and it's not right, and I'm mad, given that he agreed with the plan, he was willing to give me 60 minutes. And then I would update him again and say, "Okay, this is what we've done and this is what we're going to do, and we'll update you again at 10**:

00 AM." So I was buying life one hour at a time.
:
Now the other thing I did, and this is a good thing about Amazon, as more and more leaders got copied into this angry thread, they started reaching out in back channel and saying, "We've all been under Jeff's Eye of Sauron, we know it's miserable. What can we do to help?" And essentially Andy Jassy's organization, which was AWS at that time, and his CTO, a guy named Werner Vogels said, "You're having a database problem, let's get you some principal engineers from the AWS database team."
:

**And these principal engineers showed up at 9**:

00 AM roughly, and they looked at our design. We had made some fundamental mistakes in our database usage and they said, "It's too complicated to fix this. We're just going to give you 500 AWS machines so that your crappy design will run anyway. That's the immediate fix." And I'm like, "Okay, well I guess if you have 500 databases lying around because you're AWS, it's a great solution," and that's what they did.
:
So the next step is we fixed the problem. A bunch of us worked together very hard to get the problem all fixed. Now it took all day, and Jeff was still frustrated because the opportunity to sort of control the messaging and the media by having his letter up had passed. People had noticed our launch and the articles had been written, and so Jeff was still very mad.
:
So we fixed the problem, but Jeff now had no trust in us. The weekend went by. He was using the system looking for bugs because he is like, "This team's not reliable now. Ethan's not reliable. I better check it myself." So you have the CEO checking on you.
:

**And he found a problem and emailed me like Saturday night at 9**:

00 like, "I was doing this and it broke." And luckily I was able to tell him exactly what happened by 9:30. Anyway, the next part of the story is that following week, I had a meeting with him on another topic.
:
So I was part of this small group that was trying to figure out how to build a competing browser. You may not remember, but Amazon had a browser called Silk for a while. And I was invited to this meeting, but I wasn't a critical participant. So you may know this idea from Scrum where they say some people are pigs and some are chickens, and the chickens are sort of observers. I was a chicken in this meeting, and that turns out to be a great analogy because I was thinking, should I chicken out and not go? I could skip this meeting with the CEO who's angry at me. But when I had that thought, I realized if I can't face the CEO, I'd better pack my desk. That's the end.
:
So I went to this meeting early, and Jeff always sat in the same chair, so I knew where he would sit when he came in. So I sat down right next to his chair and I thought, "I don't know, let's find out."
:
And so the meeting goes by, and of course in my mind Jeff is totally ignoring me, not even looking at me. But I think that's just me projecting, because remember I wasn't central to the meeting.
:
So at the end of the meeting, everybody gets up to leave. He turns and looks at me and says, "So how are you doing? I bet it's been a hard week." And I thought, "Oh, okay, we're going to talk." And I said, "Yeah," I just sort of answered him with, "Of course it's been hard, but here's what we're doing and here's what we're going to do in the future." And we had a very human conversation. And I didn't believe Jeff would've forgotten that I let him down, but it was clear he had forgiven it.
:
So I was still going to have to, as it turns out, re-earn his trust. But the thing I did that's key for people to learn from is it's really easy to flame. He had been flaming me, writing angry emails. Angry emails are easy. Sitting three feet from someone and being angry with them face-to-face is hard. And when faced with, I can either start ranting at this person who reports to me, or I can say something nice, he chose to say something nice, and that rebuilt our relationship.
:
So the end of the story is two years later, I was promoted to vice president. So even though I had failed the CEO on this very public launch where he was very definitely mad at me, I re-earned the trust, I showed I had learned the lessons of how to launch more reliably without outages, and I was promoted.
:
And so I share that story because I think what I want people to understand is if I can get away with publicly failing one of the richest and most famous inventors on earth, and then get promoted and finish my career at Amazon very successfully, you can dig out of any hole. You just have to manage it right.
Lenny :
That is an amazing story. So there's a lot of lessons that I want to pull on here. One is just if you get caught in a situation like this where something completely fails, what I took down as you were talking, one is admit, yes, this is a huge problem, own it. This is like, don't try to deflect.
:
Two is the way I describe what you did here, is something I call prioritizing and communicating, where you prioritize, "Here's what we need to do," and then communicate. "Here's our priorities." And I love that you have this every hour, "Here's the latest, here's the latest." So make people understand you are on it and you'll continue to keep them updated. I imagine one of the worst fears is I have no idea what's happening here. I'm going to go in and start micromanaging.
Ethan Evans :
You're exactly right. I'm trying to hold off micromanagement. I'm trying to give them, "Okay, I believe with this and I can wait an hour," and then I can wait an another hour because that team seems to be on it. So I'm trying to rebuild trust one hour at a time, and avoid having three or four levels of management all come in and start helping.
Lenny :
Then I love this other piece of advice of meet them in person, try to take it offline essentially, which I know you did later. But that's such a good point that it's hard to be as mad, and angry, and flamey in person. People are just going to be like, "Okay, I get it. Let's try to figure this out." Amazing. Is there anything else? Those are the three that I took away. Just like if you're caught in that situation in the moment, is there anything else that you found to be really helpful?
Ethan Evans :
I mean, work hard and fast, right? You do have to fix the problem. My team had been up all night. I had to start sending people home to sleep in shifts. We had to pull in all this help. And so it was a very hard weekend.
:
When you have a mistake, it's on you to pull out the stops, even if it's uncomfortable to recover from it. And again, this is not the time to be like, "Well, it's the weekend now, and my team, we'll hit it Monday." I'd have been out the door so fast, I would've had the comic Wile E. Coyote skid marks as I bumped down the street. So I would say that's important. It's part of showing ownership.
Lenny :
The other part of this is something I went through for a while when I was starting to become a more senior leader is I had a lot of imposter syndrome, and this fear that if I messed up, everything would crumble. People would see that I don't actually know what I'm doing, and I'm not really ready for this level of seniority. And so there's this fear of one big mistake, it's over. Clearly this was an example of a huge mistake and it was not over for you. Is there any lessons there that you take away of you can mess up and still do well, even if it's this level of mistake?
Ethan Evans :
I think a lot of people in my position would've quit. They would've let the shame... I was just a little bit bullheaded where I'm like, "Yeah, I messed up. But I know I'm still a good person and a good worker. Yes, I made a mistake, but I'm going to move on." Part of the story I haven't told that you might enjoy is I mentioned that Jeff Wilke was Jeff's number two at that point. Jeff Bezos, number two person, and he was my skip level.
:
Well, during this process, he came physically into our offices and he wanted to talk to me, and my manager who was vice president said, "Hey Jeff, this is my team. I own it. If you have any criticism, say it to me. You don't mean to talk to my team." And Jeff Wilke said to my boss, whose name was Paul, "Paul, that's excellent leadership. I really appreciate what you're doing. Please step out of the way. I want to talk to Ethan. You're doing a great job, Paul. Now step aside." And then he kind of read me the riot act.
:
And the rest of that funny story is I was so happy with how well my meeting with Jeff Bezos went, I patted myself on the back and like, "I'm going to go face Jeff Wilke now. I'm going to schedule a meeting with him and do the same thing. I've got this down."
:
So I go to meet with Jeff Wilke, figuring I'm going to run the same playbook. I'm going to look him in the eye and all will be forgiven. And Jeff Wilke looks at me and says, "Ethan, when you launched this, did you know you were gambling with the result? Did you know it might not work?" And I said, "Yes. We had a media commitment to launch on that day, and I thought shooting for the date was more important than perfect certainty."
:
And he said, "Well, two things. First, you were wrong. You were wrong to prioritize date over our reputation. You let Amazon down in public and that was a mistake." He said, "Second though, at least you knew you were gambling. If you hadn't known you were gambling, we'd be discussing your departure." And I'm like, "Okay." Here I thought I was rolling in this meeting like I'm going to run my relationship playbook. And he's evaluating whether or not to keep me.
:
The bullheadedness is even after he had told me he had been considering firing me, I'm like, "Well he isn't. So I'm just going to go forward." And a lot of that stubbornness of sure I made a mistake, but I'm not going to live in shame about it, I think is what people can take away. I think a lot of people feel they're more dead in the water than they are.
:
Because everybody makes mistakes, right? I mean Jeff and Fire Phone, that'll be an albatross around his neck. Jeff and Fire Phone will be a phrase of anybody who knows Amazon for the rest of his life.
Lenny :
Yeah, we talked about it on the Working Backwards podcast, and why didn't Working Backwards work for the Fire Phone, we talked about it. I love that these quotes and lines are so seared in your brain. You can remember it like word for word exactly what-
Ethan Evans :
Well, I've relived that moment many times.
Lenny :
And then just along the lines of working your way out of the hole, is essentially what you did just succeed for two years and do great, and that was the key there?
Ethan Evans :
No, I think I did have to learn. I've always been sort of an operational cowboy, meaning I like to go fast and loose. I prioritize speed, and I really had to step back and say, "Okay, Amazon at this level and scale doesn't like that." So I've taught myself a new phrase which was fear the New York Times headline. Be aware that if Amazon is down, it goes up on every news website immediately. And so if Amazon has some kind of mistake, it's on Wall Street Journal and CNN.
:
And so as a leader, I had to think, is what I'm doing going to generate a New York Times headline? Because if it is, I'd better be really careful. And that's what I taught myself is you can't be paralyzed, but I taught my whole team, we don't want to be in the New York Times for the wrong thing. And that was the lesson
Lenny :
Along the lines of lessons, last question here, what's something that you took away from the way you approached it that you should have changed or should have done differently, that you've done differently since? Obviously don't... You mentioned this idea of don't promise a date that you're not that certain you're going to hit. I guess is there anything along those lines?
Ethan Evans :
I have two things here. First, Amazon loved in the past, they loved surprise launches. They love the idea of we're going to be quiet, quiet, quiet. Because basically it was a reaction I think to Microsoft where they felt Microsoft always talked about what was coming and then pushed the dates back. And so there was this whole thing about vaporware. And Amazon wanted to be the other way, which is we won't say anything and then it will just be there. The problem I came to say is the biggest thing I learned with surprise launches is that you're surprised by what doesn't work.
:
And so I shifted the approach to let's do a lot of beta testing. We always, even if others don't agree quite and say, "You're right, we're not going to have a surprise launch." Some of our beta testers, even if they sign NDAs are going to leak. And that's a better outcome than launching something that doesn't work. That's one lesson.
:
The other lesson is this thing that broke in front of Jeff Bezos, ultimately it was a new college graduate engineer who wrote that code. And he had been left alone to write part of our user interface, but he had written it in such a way that it didn't scale. Now we didn't give him any help or oversight. We left him on his own, because we were busy focusing on other pieces of the problem.
:
And shortly after the disaster, he left the company. And the mistake I made was not reaching out to him and really reassuring him of, "Yes, you wrote the bug, but that's not on you. The system failed you and we don't see you. Bugs happen."
:
So the thing I regret in this whole thing is not realizing that even though no one in the team ever yelled at him or whatever, he knew it was his bug, and he obviously saw me and others sort of taking a beating. And so he left, and I wish he hadn't done that. And I wish more than that I had stepped in. I didn't realize what he was feeling.
Lenny :
It's interesting, the lesson there isn't catch that person sooner, and notice these links in the chain that may break. But it's more just be there for that human that have this challenge, that people may not be focusing on.
Ethan Evans :
Because we lost a good person, and he probably felt very bad about it. And we all feel bad when we make mistakes. That can't be prevented. But he felt undue responsibility I think, and that I really regret.
Lenny :
This is actually a really good example of ownership. You mentioned this term ownership and that connects to... Amazon has these leadership principles. I think there's 14 of them. One of them is around ownership. And apparently you helped craft the actual language for that principle, which I think is a huge deal with Amazon. I imagine very few people have a say over how to define, and describe, and say these principles. Could you just talk about this principle that you contributed to, how it came to be that you helped actually write it?
Ethan Evans :
Amazon is now kind of on its fourth version in my mind, maybe there's more. But its fourth major revision of its leadership principles over its 25 plus year history.
:
And when it was going from version one to version two, Jeff and his leadership team sat down together. And actually in version one, there were three different lists. They were leadership principles and core values, and something else I don't remember. And they were like, "Three lists is stupid. Let's make one list."
:
Well ownership, the term had been a part of one of those lists, but when they merged everything, they took it out. And this guy Jeff Wilke I mentioned, the number two and the leader of retail, he brought a bunch of us a bunch of his directors. He brought the proposed list to us in a meeting and said, "Hey, this is the proposed new version, do you have any comment?" And we all sat around and talked and said, "Where's ownership? Ownership is missing." So we told him, he said, "Look, ownership is missing. We think it should be there." And he said, "Well, why don't you propose a draft?"
:
And so about a half dozen of us sat around and roughed out a draft of how we felt ownership should be written. And I proposed these six words, which are, "An owner never says that's not my job." Maybe that's seven words.
:
So I propose this specific language as a part of it and we sent off this draft. And months go by, we hear nothing. And then one day the leadership principles are announced and ownership is back in. It's been modified, but that, "An owner never says that's not my job," is a part of the leadership principle, and it's remained to this debt.
:
And what I love about that is because Amazon has one and a half million employees who live by these leadership principles, it's probably the most impactful thing I've ever written.
Lenny :
Wow. So those seven words are the most impactful thing you've ever written. I love that and I totally get that. I'm looking at the principles right now and it comes right at the end of that principle. We'll link to the 14 leadership principles. Is there another principle that you really love or one or two? I don't know. It's probably hard to pick your favorites.
Ethan Evans :
I'm a huge proponent of bias for action. Bias for action says speed matters in business and many decisions are reversible. And so it's important to go faster.
:
And I think people don't understand that in a competitive environment, being right is good, but being quick is necessary. Because if there are 10 startups working on an idea, some of them will gamble, and they'll make bad gambles, and they'll go out of business. But some of them will gamble and make an early bet and be right. And if you are not moving quickly, you'll be beaten by the people who maybe got lucky.
:
And so you've got to have a process that values speed, values, what can we do today? What can we commit to today? So I really like bias for action. Now that is what got me in trouble with Jeff, right? I was willing to gamble. So it has to be in balance, but that's my other favorite.
Lenny :
Again, the Jeff Bezos interview with Lex Fridman, he was talking about how with Blue Origin, with the way Amazon, he thought about Amazon is customer obsession. That was the core goal and differentiator of Amazon. With Blue Origin, he wants it to be decisiveness. It's basically leaning into this bias for action fully, which is really interesting.
Ethan Evans :
I saw that part of the interview and I thought, "Wow, that's exactly right." Because again, rockets blow up and they have people on them. You've got to get it right, but you also have to keep moving, because there's always one more thing you can safety test. So how do you balance it?
Lenny :
Yeah, it's interesting. With rockets, that's the one that you pick. It's pretty bold to be all move forward kind of thing. So this principle, again, going back to ownership, so you basically suggested this phrase, "You didn't hear anything," and all of a sudden it becomes part of the whole thing. Did that feel weird that they never told you, or I don't know if they gave you credit for that, or it's like, no, it's great?
Ethan Evans :
Yeah, I wouldn't even claim credit for it, except I kept a copy of the email that says, "Ethan thinks it should say blah." I have the written proof. Because it's not about the credit. I'm very happy and proud that those words were kept. But in Amazon, I doubt if Jeff knows I wrote those words. It's not like I've ever told him, "Hey, do you know you kept my words?" That's not appropriate. It's just a fun anecdote.
:
And it does show, I guess something people can learn from that though, you can influence way up in a company if your ideas are good. And also, when we challenged, Jeff Wilke was a strong opinionated leader who didn't necessarily always love being challenged.
:
And so when we first told him, "Well, we think you're missing ownership," he was like, "You're staying that the whole S team can't get its leadership principles right?" I mean it wasn't exactly that way, but he was very much like, "Well, is this really necessary? Why do you think it's necessary?" And his challenge to us to write it was kind of framed as, "Well if you're so sure it's good, show us." But again, I'm stubborn and I'm like, "All right, let's write it." And we did.
Lenny :
That's funny. That's not a great example of leadership where he is like, "Hey guys, I need your feedback on this thing. But no, don't actually tell me anything's wrong."
Ethan Evans :
Well, yeah. I mean for a bunch of directors to kind of critique the work of people two levels higher, he wanted it, but then he's sort of naturally resistant to it if we're kind of poking at his baby.
Lenny :
It's unlikely that there's something huge missing and it turns out there was.
Ethan Evans :
Yeah.
Lenny :
And I guess just on these principles, people may not know this, but this is where disagree and commit comes from. It's actually have backbone, disagree, and commit. We talked about this on the podcast about working backwards. I also love leaders are right a lot. That comes up a lot and I love that, to be successful, you need to be right. You can't just project confidence. You can't just be in a bunch of meetings and ship things. You need to be right to be successful.
Ethan Evans :
And that one's been rewritten to carefully say, it's always interesting what is the history of the edits, which you wish you could see the edit history on these. That one got modified to say something about leaders actively work to disconfirm their beliefs.
:
And the key there is it was trying to get at the idea that you've got to be very open and always be questioning, "Yes, I think I'm right, but what's the new evidence? What am I learning? What's changing?" And in fact, it also says they seek diverse perspectives.
:
And that was a way of getting at what's called DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion. That's a subtle nod towards if everyone in the room is a 50-year-old white man, you may not really be making the right overall decision for Amazon's customer base. You may be making the one for 50-year-old white suburban Seattleites. And so it's just some of these, every word in those has been studied as an individual word inside the company.
Lenny :
Amazing. Okay. Let's move on to the final area I wanted to spend a little time on, and this is called contrarian corner. I'm curious if you have any contrarian opinions about things basically that other people believe that you don't believe, something you see that many people don't see. Is there anything that comes to mind?
Ethan Evans :
Yeah, I think a place where I'm currently very contrarian is the return to office movement. Many leaders at my level appear or publicly favor the need to get back into the office potentially full-time.
:
And I'm contrarian on this because of innovation. Specifically, I looked it up, you can check my facts on Wikipedia. The first purpose-built office, the first building ever built to be an office was built in 1726 in London. And so we're about 300 years into learning how to use offices well.
:
And what that means is offices aren't going to get much better. What's the last major thing you can think of that got better in offices? You might say well open offices, but a lot of people would say that's not even a good idea. These big rows of desks and loud pits.
:
With working from home, we've only been doing that for a few years since the pandemic began and at all since the internet started 20 years ago. Which one is likely to have more opportunity for improvement? There's so many things we haven't explored with remote work. And I think the people who say, "Back to the office, it's because we know it works," well we know what it is, but I have so much more faith in the opportunity to improve the remote experience. And so I think long-term, it's going to triumph.
:
The one other place where I'm a huge contrarian is doing business on a handshake. I understand companies need lawyers, and I have an attorney for certain things. But I coach people. Most of the people I coach, there's no NDA in place. There's no contract in place. They pay me through PayPal and I do good coaching for them.
:
I think too much of the world is contract driven, and we've lost the idea of your word being your bond, and you can actually trust me to follow through on my commitments. And I'm a contrarian there.
:
I realize I will occasionally get burnt. Someone will behave in a way, they'll let me down. But I think when we're always suspicious of people, that's a high cost. And the other place I'm contrarian is just doing business on faith.
Lenny :
That reminds me, Sam Altman has a similar philosophy of just trust people and assume it'll all be okay. Sometimes you'll get burned, but on balance, it'll end up being much better for you and for everyone around you.
Ethan Evans :
I didn't know that Sam had said that, but I strongly agree with it.
Lenny :
Yeah, although he had some challenges recently. I don't know if it's working great, but it ended upgrade for him. So anyway, okay. We've actually reached our very exciting lightning round. Before we get there, is there anything else you wanted to touch on, or share, or leave listeners with?
Ethan Evans :
No, I've really enjoyed this conversation. I could talk about careers forever and I love doing that, but I think we've covered a ton today that will really help people. So I'm good. Let's hit the lightning round.
Lenny :
All right. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Ethan Evans :
I'm ready.
Lenny :
Ethan, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Ethan Evans :
Two or three books. My number one recommendation is a book called Decisive. It's by Chip and Dan Heath, and it's about the science of making better decisions. The reason I recommend it so much is it will make your career better because leaders are decision makers, but also your personal life. So I apply it at least as much in my personal life as I do in my professional life.
:
My second most recommended book is Leadership and Self Deception, much less known than Decisive, a little bit harder to approach. It's by a group, a research group called the Arbinger Institute, and it's about, the self-deception is we cause a lot of our interpersonal problems while blaming them on others. And it walks through how are you part of the problem you're having with somebody else and what can you do about it?
:

**The third and final book was recently brought to me by someone I work with that you know, Jason [inaudible 01**:

13:21]. That book is The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant. And Naval Ravikant is an angel investor responsible for AngelList.
:
But what I love about that book is he has a recipe. He really boils down how to be successful while loving what you do. And he says, "No one can be a better version of you." Don't try to copy me and be, "I'm going to be like Ethan, or I'm going to be like Lenny." Instead, figure out what you uniquely do best that you love, because no one can copy you being you. And that's your defensible sort of career value. And I really like that mental model.
Lenny :
Yeah, Naval has so many insightful messages, and you can read all these on his Twitter. We'll link to his Twitter, and someone just made a book out of his tweets basically. He's such an interesting dude.
Ethan Evans :
Yes, that's right.
Lenny :
Awesome. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?
Ethan Evans :
So I grew up on a farm, and so all the Taylor Sheridan, 1923, and Yellowstone, and all of those series, we've watched everything he's put out. We do kind of laugh like, wow. Are you familiar with Yellowstone at all?
Lenny :
Absolutely. A lot of death.
Ethan Evans :
Yeah. At one point my wife and I were watching it, we would start betting. So the episode is starting, how many people will die in this episode? This ranch in Montana, but yet somehow they're always killing people. How does this work?
Lenny :
That's what your life was like, is what I'm hearing. Favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?
Ethan Evans :
I think my favorite interview question is, "Tell me about a time where you needed to disagree with your management, where you needed to stand up or fight for a position against higher leadership or people in power." Because I think that's really hard to do. I'm normally interviewing leaders, and I think having a bunch of people who just say yes isn't helpful. You need people to have, as you said, have backbone, disagree and commit. So that's what I'm normally looking for.
Lenny :
Awesome. Is there favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?
Ethan Evans :
It's silly, but my favorite product that I've discovered recently is the Chuckit!, which you use to whip a ball for your dog a quarter mile. It basically extends your arm. And it's just fun to send a ball soaring way further than you could ever throw it. And you feel like, "Wow, look at me. I'm a major league pitcher." Because I have this three foot lever arm and I understand physics. If we look at tech products, there's so many I love. It's too easy to say ChatGPT and stuff, so I won't go there.
Lenny :
Awesome. My dog does not love chasing balls, so I haven't had a reason to buy that, but I've never thought about just the joy of flicking a ball really far. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with folks, find useful in work or in life?
Ethan Evans :
I happen to be a Christian, and the motto that I think about the most is, "To whom much has been given, from him much will be required." And so I think a lot about what is my social responsibility.
:
I've been very lucky. I grew up on a farm in Ohio now. I wasn't a farm boy, my father was a chemist. But I grew up in upper middle class settings, and I've ended up being extremely successful, able to retire from my job at 50 to kind of coach and teach. What do I owe to pay forward? So those words are obviously ancient spiritual texts, but they're the ones I take away and think the most about. What's my responsibility?
Lenny :
As an example of someone that to whom much has been given, but because he's worked so hard, Jeff Bezos is starting a space business as you know. If you had the chance to go to space, would you go?
Ethan Evans :
Well, I of course saw his interview where he talked about how he thought about the safety and the conversation he had to have with his mother. I would like to go to space. I'm not willing to pay what I think the current tickets are, but I would take the risk. So what's the risk of that ride? One in a hundred, one in 50, even more that you won't come back. I would probably take the gamble.
Lenny :
So you'd be an early adopter? Where along that curve would you be, an early adopter, laggard?
Ethan Evans :
Well, I'm old enough that I remember when the Challenger space shuttle exploded, and I said I would get on the next one and I said, "They're never going to be more careful than the next one, so I'll get on the next one."
:
So I think I would get on any one I was offered because of the chance. Unlike Jeff who claims he wasn't scared, I would probably be really terrified, at least at liftoff. While you're up there, it's great. Everything either goes wrong going up or coming down. It's not the middle.
Lenny :
Ethan, I think we're going to help a lot of people with their career. I think we're going to help them work through failure, become better owners. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? Also, just share what you do now in case people could use that help. And then how can listeners useful to you?
Ethan Evans :
So the best place to find me online, I do all my writing on LinkedIn. It's where the professional community is. So Ethan Evans on LinkedIn. My actual handle there is Ethan Evans VP for my history as a vice president. That's the best place to find me. I do have a Substack newsletter. I do teach through the Maven platform, but all of those are linked off LinkedIn.
:
And really, how readers help me, they comment on what I write, because I miss things. I am one person's perspective. And so I actually have a process where I take in all the comments people write, all the different perspectives, all the different exceptions, or special cases, or examples, and that's how I improve my own thinking is I read every comment and think, "Okay, what did I miss? What could I have said better? How can I incorporate this if I ever talk about this again?"
Lenny :
Just to give you another opportunity to plug the stuff you do now, what do you help people with in case people could value could you use the stuff that you offer? You said you coach, you have a course. What sort of stuff?
Ethan Evans :
I focus on two topics, career development. So how do you row in your career, the whole Magic Loop, and how do you attain promotion or attain a new role raise if that's your goal? And then leadership specifically. I teach a course that's been very popular called Stuck at Senior Manager - Breaking Through To Executive, which is how to get out of that sort of stuck, "I'm working really hard, I'm pretty good. I'm managing 25 or 50 people, but how do I get to the big chair? How do I get to the division level leadership and what do I need to change?" It's that whole what got you here won't get you there. And I love to see people succeed at that. People write me back and say, "I did get a job. I did get promoted, I did get a raise," and that's my fulfillment.
Lenny :
Amazing. Ethan, thank you so much for being here.
Ethan Evans :
Thank you, Lenny. And I got to say, you are very good at this. You're so smooth and you just do a great job interviewing. It's been really been a pleasure.
