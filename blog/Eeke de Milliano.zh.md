### Bird by Bird

Instructions on Writing and Life by Anne Lamott. It's incredible. So touching. Really, really great. Also, I think product managers should be great writers. So, I love that.
Eeke de Milliano :
And then the other book that I was going to say, but I'm glad you mentioned Claire, is Claire's book, Scaling People, which is coming out. I had a very small hand in ghost writing for her a little bit, in the first draft. So I use a lot of the early chapters from that book still, in management. And I still...

**So we built... Essentially, we spin up a post [inaudible 00**:

33:32] database for you. And you can just access it via a really nice UI and manage it directly in Retool.
Lenny :
Amazing. Okay, back to the other two questions.
Eeke de Milliano :
Yes. Okay. So I think your second question was, "Was this a good idea?"
Lenny :
Right.
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. You know what? I think in hindsight, if I were to do it again, I think sequencing it would've been slightly better. Just because, I think what we ended up doing is, we ended up launching the idea behind all three of these products at around the same time. And they all ended up maturing at around the same time, and that was just a lot of headspace from the org. Even though actually, the teams themselves were not that big.
Eeke de Milliano :
It was just like, we had all these products and we were just waiting for them to launch and waiting for them to launch. Whereas, maybe if we'd sequenced it, I think that would've felt more satisfying to the whole organization.
Eeke de Milliano :
But, I mean, it ended up working out. I think that's kind of the crazy thing. It's like, we were able to pull off launching these three products.
Eeke de Milliano :
And by the way, I should caveat that, the further I get along my career, the more I realize I'm just kind of building on the shoulders of giants. And a lot of these ideas, et cetera, were very much in the works and were happening before I came along.
Eeke de Milliano :
But yeah, it was really neat to see how we got that all over the finish line in a year.
Lenny :
And then, the last question there is just, what do you think you did to allow for this? Because it's pretty rare you can build so much. And I know the team's not huge. How many people work at Retool, roughly?
Eeke de Milliano :
Today, we're around 300 people.
Lenny :
Yeah. So how do you structure an org to build three and launch... I didn't realize they launched around the same time. It's like, I'm picturing Elon Musk launching three rockets at once. How do you allow for that to happen?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah, I'm sure our product marketing team felt that way. Yeah, a couple of things. We started really small with all of these initiatives.
Eeke de Milliano :
So I think I mentioned, we really had one or two people working on each of these products for the first six months. So it was one engineer and one designer, or one engineer and one PM. And they really didn't get funding until it was clear that there was something there.
Eeke de Milliano :
So those teams, they spent a ton of time with customers. They spent a ton of time building, a ton of time prototyping. And it was kind of the moment where it was like, "Okay, they are there." That we started bringing more people onto the team.
Eeke de Milliano :
So, that was the first piece. The second piece is that, we really treated them like startups. We're like, Retool's the VC, and Retool funds with resources and Retool's existing customer base. Which is obviously quite valuable, because you have all these customers you can market to and promote to.
Eeke de Milliano :
But then, the teams really had to prove that ROI. Either in engagement, or eventually revenue, in order to be able to move forward.
Eeke de Milliano :
And then the third thing... And this one, actually I think it can be quite controversial. Is, we were really deliberate about keeping these teams separate from the rest of the org, especially early on. Now, a lot of them, they're very much a part of the overall organizational processes.
Eeke de Milliano :
But very early on, they were running on their own. They were meeting quite independently with one, or two, or three folks from the leadership team. And they were also just quite separate from the product itself.
Eeke de Milliano :
I think Retool Mobile's actually a really good example, where we had a lot of debate about whether or not we should build Retool Mobile out of the core web app builder. Because a lot of the primitives are the same.
Eeke de Milliano :
And we eventually decided that we were going to run it as a separate team, because we wanted the team to be able to move really, really quickly. And we didn't want it to get bogged down in, what are just the realities of running a product that has product market fit, like bugs, yada, yada, et cetera.
Eeke de Milliano :
And I think that was absolutely the right call, because Retool Mobile actually has quite a different target customer. Which, we only really realized maybe like halfway through the project. And I don't think we would've been able to really understand that, or even get broader in that kind of thinking, had we sort of been stuck in the core retail product.
Eeke de Milliano :
But yeah, there was a cost to that, too. Which is like, "Okay, now we have these two products, and we have to..." I think obviously the strength will be, "How do all these products interact with each other, and how do they build on top of each other?"
Eeke de Milliano :
So, we have to go and invest in that now. But I think it's totally worth it, because your team can just move more quickly, be more independent, and think more independently, too.
Lenny :
In the time that you worked at Stripe and Retool... I know we chatted before we started recording. You think a lot about, "What is the right level of process for companies at different stages?"
Lenny :
And I'd love to just hear your thoughts, because I know that's a challenge a lot of companies face. "How much do we put in now? Do we get inspiration from big companies? Do we try to stay lean?"
Lenny :
Something here, that we actually run into. I'll just mention briefly that, there was a huge resistance to process for a long time. And so the product team was just kind of a little crazy for a bit. And then we were like, "Okay, we need product development process. We need deadlines and specs." And that helped a lot.
Lenny :
So let me ask again, just how do you think about the right level of process for a stage of company, and what have you learned there?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. What I would really love from companies is just sort of like this time capsule, where you can see what their processes were when they were like 20 people, and 50 people, and 100 people, and 500 people.
Eeke de Milliano :
Because when we were at Stripe and we were trying to figure out our planning process, we actually talked to Amazon, and Atlassian, and Apple, and all these companies that we really, really respect and look up to.
Eeke de Milliano :
And I remember taking down notes from these companies and being like, "Yeah, this is awesome, but there's no way that this will work for Stripe." Stripe was so much smaller than any of these companies.
Eeke de Milliano :
So yeah, they were showing us where we had to go, but no idea how to get there. And so, yeah, Lenny, maybe you can help us figure out time capsules for companies and what processes make sense.
Lenny :
Yeah. I am working on that, roughly.
Eeke de Milliano :
Oh, nice.
Lenny :
I'm going company by company, about how they think process and about process. And then maybe I'll check in every couple of years.
Eeke de Milliano :
Cool. I love that. But yeah, to answer your question directly. Process... Yeah, it really gives people a bitter taste in their mouth, I think.
Eeke de Milliano :
Process, by definition, is variance reducing. You're introducing it, because you worry that the variance in your org is too high. You want people to sort of meet a certain standard.
Eeke de Milliano :
And the cost of that is obviously, while you are reducing the standard and bringing folks up to the average, you're also bringing other folks down to the average. And oftentimes, the folks you're bringing down are your highest performers, your most creative thinkers. The folks who, I think actually don't really need process to do their best work.
Eeke de Milliano :
And so, that, I think is always the tension that you have with process. And obviously one of the reasons why companies introduce process much more and more, as companies get bigger, is because it's harder to get all these folks who don't need processing. You actually want to reduce the variance.
Eeke de Milliano :
This is actually a little bit of an aside, but it's kind of relevant, so I'm just going to mention it. And you can feel free to let me know if it's too much of an aside.
Lenny :
Let's get into it.
Eeke de Milliano :
But, I was just listening to this awesome podcast with Russ Roberts, who's a professor. He hosts EconTalk. I don't know if you listen to it.
Eeke de Milliano :
And he was in interviewing this guy, Ian Leslie, who's this great writer and has just written this article that's... Basically, something along the lines of what it means to be human in the age of AI.
Eeke de Milliano :
And I thought he just articulated this idea well. Which is, we're all really so impressed when we see ChatGPT-3 spit out this piece of writing that feels very human-like.
Eeke de Milliano :
But what we're kind of forgetting is that, over the last 10, 20, 30 years, we're actually asking humans to be a lot more robot-like. In that, we're really asking everyone to standardize in a lot of ways. And we're making people a lot more formulaic. If you think about how we teach people to write, it's like, "Well, there's five paragraphs. And there's your opening paragraph. And you state your topic."
Eeke de Milliano :
So anyway, I think the point is, the more formulaic, the more sort of mass produced you're trying to make something. The more you kind of quench people's creativity, and the further away you get from the really, really high highs. And that, to me, is the cost of process, and rules, and templates.
Eeke de Milliano :
So if you're going to introduce it, be really, really sure that you're okay with that cost. And give folks escape hatches.
Eeke de Milliano :
So I've started referring to this as the MVP, the minimum viable process. So if I give folks a template, I'm like, "Look, use the template. But if you want to break out of it, please absolutely do." And I've started writing this at the top of templates now.
Eeke de Milliano :
It's like, "If this doesn't work for what you're trying to explain, don't use it. But just know that this is the minimum viable thing. We're setting the bar here, but go higher if you can, please."
Eeke de Milliano :
So anyway, that's my sort of long drive on process. With all that said, I do think that companies, there's just a set of documents that are really, really viable. That every sort of level of the organization should have throughout its lifecycle.
Eeke de Milliano :
And then, I think how sort of involved it is, or how long term it is really depends on how big you are.
Eeke de Milliano :
But those documents, to me, are the charter. So, "What is your mission, your vision and your strategy?" The goals, "What are you aiming to do and how are you going to measure success?" And then the roadmap, "What is the thing that you're shipping?"
Eeke de Milliano :
And I think the whole company needs these, the whole function. So in product, you need all three of these. And then, within each team you need all three of these.
Eeke de Milliano :
And I've kind of noticed two things about this framework for myself. One, I've actually noticed that teams often work their way from the bottom-up, versus top-down. They start with a roadmap. They're like, "What are all the things we're going to ship?" Especially early on. And then they kind of work their way into a charter. But I think it's really, really worth it to start from the top-down.
Eeke de Milliano :
And then, the second thing that I've noticed is that your time horizon really shifts as you get more mature. So if you're very early on, you don't have PMF, you should have a charter, but your charter should be like three months in the future. Because you can't look that much further.
Eeke de Milliano :
And if you're a company that's humming and going, your charter is probably... The horizon's maybe a decade.
Lenny :
Wow. There is so much there. I could go into so many different directions. One thing I wanted to follow up on a little bit, is this idea... Such a great point. That process brings the best people down and kind of averages them out to create consistency.
Lenny :
And I'm curious if there's anything else you've seen succeed in allowing the best and most innovative brains to just do their thing. I know part of it is probably hiring amazing people. But yeah, is there anything else that's an escape hatch of just like, "Oh yeah, this person, just go. Go figure this out."
Eeke de Milliano :
To me, the unlock for organizations is managers, for this. Because you need managers to both detect the high performers and be like, "This person doesn't need the process." And then you need managers to give that person air cover to be like, "We're honestly..." Because what you're doing is, you're giving them some special treatment and you need to be kind of okay with that.
Eeke de Milliano :
And you also need to be okay with the organizational cost for that. Claire, who used to be the COO of Stripe, would always say, "Are you willing to break the org for this person?" And I always thought that was a really nice framing. And you kind of need to decide who you want to do it for, too.
Eeke de Milliano :
But yeah, some people are just that good that like, "Yeah, of course you'll break the org for them." They're going to break the org in the best way possible.
Lenny :
Yeah. I love that term. I think Claire's coming on this podcast. She just wrote a book, right? Is that the same person?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah.
Lenny :
Okay, great.
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah, she just wrote a book. Yep.
Lenny :
All right, we just booked her. Come, and maybe we'll spend some time together.
Eeke de Milliano :
That's awesome.
Lenny :
Do you have any other product building philosophies that you found especially useful in your time at Stripe, and Retool, and anywhere else?
Eeke de Milliano :
I have a couple of, I guess, specific mental models that I use. The first is, build for your best user, not your worst user.
Eeke de Milliano :
And what I mean by that is, I think it's actually really easy to get stuck, or to focus on, "What if there's abuse of this product?" Or think about all the ways in which the product won't be used well. And then you end up sort of shaping the product in these really weird funky ways to make up for that.
Eeke de Milliano :
Whereas in reality, the worst users, they should be a fraction of your users anyway. So you shouldn't really be building for them.
Eeke de Milliano :
I think a really good example of this is onboarding processes. Where, you're probably going to be building an onboarding process, where you're trying to collect a lot of data. Or trying to figure out, "Hey, how do I help this user who maybe isn't well suited for my product to be successful?"
Eeke de Milliano :
Really, you should just be building an onboarding process for the user who's going to jump into your product and get it immediately.
Eeke de Milliano :
I was thinking about this actually just the other day. Because we were in this product review, and we were talking about this other new product that we're thinking of exploring.
Lenny :
More products? It never ends.
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah, exactly. And we're kind of going down this path of like, "Oh, well if this gets really big, there's going to be all this abuse of the product." And Anthony, our founder was like, "Wouldn't that be an amazing problem to have?" And we're like, "Yeah, that's a really good point."
Eeke de Milliano :
So we kind of put that on the back burner.
Lenny :
That's an interesting approach, because usually you're trying to optimize a flow, get more people through it, which are the least good users.You're saying you found more success just focusing...
Lenny :
Is this more initially, focus on the users that will understand this, and be excited about it, and make that work really well. And then, over time, build on that?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah, totally. Yeah, sure. If you're going to look at the end, and you're trying to optimize, et cetera, absolutely. But in that sort of early product development stage, it's just not worth it to be too focused on that.
Lenny :
Got it. Sweet.
Eeke de Milliano :
So, that's one. The other one, our head of design, Ryan, always kind of reminds us of is, build the scooter, not the axle.
Eeke de Milliano :
So if you're trying to build the minimum viable product for a car, don't build just the wheels and the axle, build the scooter first. And then from there, you build the bicycle, and the motorcycle, and then the car.
Eeke de Milliano :
And it's always just such a good reminder. You always want to start building the whole thing. But really try and think about the slice that gets the customer to complete value on a smaller thing first.
Eeke de Milliano :
So with Retool Mobile for example, there's just so much you could be building there. And we decided very specifically, "Hey, we're only going to build this for companies that have field workers and they would need to do inventory management."
Eeke de Milliano :
And it's a very specific slice, but it helps get through from something that was actually viable, beginning to end.
Lenny :
Got it. So it's an approach for MVPs, basically. Make something simple and functional, not just something barely... Not actually working, but getting you to some dream product eventually.
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. And then the last one is this idea of 70/20/10 split investments. I really think that a lot of product management can sometimes be reduced to funnels and portfolios.
Eeke de Milliano :
So the 70/20/10 investments model in my head is just like, 70% of your building time should really be going to your core product, that has product market fit. 20% of your time should be going to strategic initiatives that aren't core, but they're strategic to the company, that you know have to do them. And then, 10% of your time should be going towards bets.
Lenny :
That's actually exactly the same heuristic I've always used. One question there is, how do you think about maintenance and bugs within that?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. To me, that falls squarely in the 70%. So yeah, core product, tech debt, sort of the maintenance mode type stuff. And core product, obviously you're also doing a bunch of new stuff there too.
Eeke de Milliano :
But yeah, no more than 70% of your resources should be going there.
Lenny :
What did you say the 20% was?
Eeke de Milliano :
Strategic initiatives that aren't your core, but you just know, based on your strategy, you have to do these things.
Lenny :
Got it. So the way I break it up is, 20% is where I put bugs and maintenance. And then 10% was big, ambitious bets. So it was similar ratios, but different things go into the buckets.
Eeke de Milliano :
Cool.
Lenny :
But, let me ask a similar question. How do you, at Retool, and maybe even at Stripe, think about finding time to do maintenance and bugs? Do you build it into roadmaps? Do you set off time to just fix all the bugs? I know it's probably an evolution, and it goes back and forth. But, any thoughts?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. This, I think, is really one of the trickiest parts of product management, in my mind.
Eeke de Milliano :
We don't have a company-wide sort of process on this. It's pretty team specific. Some teams do Friday bug bashes. Other teams are just, as products roll out, will work on them as they go.
Eeke de Milliano :
I was actually speaking to a product manager at a different company, who mentioned that they just spent the last 18 months doing just product polish and bugs. And I think they landed in a place where they had to do it, because they just had so much debt. But luckily, we're not there yet.
Eeke de Milliano :
Right now, we let most of the teams just kind of do it themselves and figure out what makes sense for them.
Lenny :
Okay. Awesome. I wanted to go back to something that I've heard about Retool, that you all are really good at. Which is PM's being really close to customers. And I'm curious what you've done there, or what the team has done there, that it's been really effective?
Eeke de Milliano :
Well, I do think every good product team figures out how to get close to customers. But just based off of my observations from Retool, and what I've seen at other companies, there are a couple things that are more pronounced at Retool than I've seen in a lot of other places.
Eeke de Milliano :
The first is, we have a lot of PMs who used to be in customer-facing roles, at Retool. I obviously am a big fan of that. I think there's just nothing like really understanding the value of your product, at the moment where a customer actually has to put money down. And so, I really like that about PMs, who have had those conversations with customers and they really get it.
Eeke de Milliano :
Second is, because the retail product is so technical... And I do think this just depends on what product you have. Our PMs are really, very technical. Everyone has either a CS degree, or has done some sort of engineering in the past.
Eeke de Milliano :
Third is, we use Slack very heavily to talk to our customers and interact with them. So at this point, I think we have hundreds of Slack channels with customers. Every time we're testing a new product, or a new customer who's somewhat large, comes online. We will work with them in Slack, to get there off-the-cuff feedback, just back and forth. It's really nice. We just have this direct line to them, which is awesome.
Eeke de Milliano :
And then, the fourth thing we do is, we use Retool to build Retool. So our product roadmap lives in a Retool app. And the app that we use to have feature flags for particular features, is a Retool app. So PMs are just in the product all day long, every day. They're their own customers in a lot of ways, and that really helps as well.
Lenny :
Wow, I didn't know that. That is very cool. So you build a task management product using Retool?
Eeke de Milliano :
Oh, yeah. Well, we built many... Basically, all of our internal tooling happens in Retool. Like, our PMs, all their team dashboards are in Retool. All of their task tracking is in Retool. Submitting linear requests or bug requests happens in Retool, and then goes to Linear. So yeah, it's how we run the company.
Lenny :
You haven't been able to replace Linear yet? That's cool. I'm a big fan of Linear.
Lenny :
Okay, two more questions and then I'll let you go. One is around product growth. Which, I don't want to get too into. We've talked about it a bunch on this podcast.
Lenny :
But, it's interesting that Stripe was very product-led growth. It was just self-serve PMs, engineers, whoever, just started using it. It grew and became enterprisey down the road.
Lenny :
Retool, on the other hand, I think people think it's product-led growth. I imagine it's actually sales-led, mostly.
Lenny :
And so, I'm just curious what you've learned about the difference between building product and leading product teams within a sales-led org, versus a product-led org.
Eeke de Milliano :
I have a couple of insights on that. One interesting insight is that, teams that have one always want the other.
Lenny :
That's so true.
Eeke de Milliano :
Whenever I talk to candidates, I feel like you can always tell what their company has, because they'll be asking a lot of questions about the opposite. If they're probably a growth company they'll be like, "Well, how are you guys thinking about Enterprise?"
Eeke de Milliano :
And then, if they are more of a sales-led growth company, they're like, "Well, how are you guys thinking about your self-serve motion, or your product-led growth?"
Eeke de Milliano :
And my main takeaway, just in... And I don't know if I would even use the dichotomy of product-led growth, or sales-led growth, with Retool. I think we do have a lot of product-led growth. But we work with a lot of enterprise customers, and a lot of our revenue comes from enterprise customers, and we have a fantastic sales team.
Eeke de Milliano :
And I think the main thing is that, you just have to really figure out your interaction mechanisms with sales. And that just has to be so, so tight.
Eeke de Milliano :
And it goes in both directions. There's obviously, how you get feedback from them, because they are so often on the front lines talking to customers. Moreso than product managers, even.
Eeke de Milliano :
But it also goes the other way. If you are going to ship something, or if you are going to put out a roadmap, like, "How do you make sure that the sales team has everything that they need..." The sales, and in Retool's case, the success team and the support team, "Has everything they need to accurately talk to customers about that?"
Eeke de Milliano :
And I've always actually found that really hard, because it's really hard to figure out the right altitude. If you're giving a presentation on the roadmap, people are either going to feel like it's too high level. Or, it's too low level for folks who maybe are new.
Eeke de Milliano :
So this year, we're actually trying something different. We are doing a science fair. Where, each product team has a little booth. And they get to stand there, and anyone who has questions about the product can come... You know, from the go-to-market side, can come and ask questions, and get demos, and go as deep as they need to.
Eeke de Milliano :
So, I'll let you know how that goes. But I'm excited to experiment with it.
Lenny :
Okay. Are there going to be foam core boards, and will there be ribbons?
Eeke de Milliano :
There may be prizes. Who knows?
Lenny :
Oh my God. I can't wait to see a picture of this. Final topic. You have this concept that you call the product talent portfolio. What does that mean, and how have you found that useful in your product leadership life?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. Yeah, it's back to like, all of product management is portfolios and funnels.
Eeke de Milliano :
I think it's really tempting as a manager, to build a team in your image, because you understand their skillsets and you value those skillsets. And you're going to be able to detect and assess those skillsets better.
Eeke de Milliano :
But the best product teams, in my mind, have really figured out how to balance the talent portfolio. So instead of having a bunch of PMs who all spike in one particular area, figure out how you can create complimentary skillsets for the whole PM team, so the whole is much stronger.
Eeke de Milliano :
And one way in which I like to do that is, I really like to balance product teams with homegrown product managers, who really get the product. They've probably been in it. They're amazing culture carriers, often. They really set the tone. But they may not have seen product management at other companies, and they may not have some of the more conventional and traditional product management skillsets.
Eeke de Milliano :
So I want to balance that with product managers who've come from other companies, and have done it, and can bring a little bit more of that product manager rigor. Even though they don't have, in the Retool case, the core Retool product management vibe.
Eeke de Milliano :
So, that's one example. I think there's others as well. Some PMs are just incredible execution machines. Other PMs are amazing visionaries. You kind of want a little bit of all of them.
Eeke de Milliano :
And you want to also balance within all of your different pillars. So we have three different sort of product pillars at Retool, and there's leads for all those pillars. And I always push the leads to hire people who don't look like them, so that we have balance everywhere.
Lenny :
I love that. Do you, actively, as you're hiring, "Hey, well you're strong in these areas. Here's the person we need, here. We want this specific, super strategy minded person." Is that actually how you think about this?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. I do a little personal exercise for myself every six months, where I chart out the team that we have today, and write down all of the strengths that we have, all of the weaknesses that we have, as a team. And then I try to hire specifically for those weaknesses.
Lenny :
Amazing. Any last pieces of wisdom or thoughts, before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Eeke de Milliano :
I think that's it on my end.
Lenny :
Okay. We got through everything I was hoping to get through.
Lenny :
So with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
Eeke de Milliano :
I'm ready.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you recommend most, to other people?
Eeke de Milliano :

**Bird by Bird**:

Instructions on Writing and Life by Anne Lamott. It's incredible. So touching. Really, really great. Also, I think product managers should be great writers. So, I love that.
Eeke de Milliano :
And then the other book that I was going to say, but I'm glad you mentioned Claire, is Claire's book, Scaling People, which is coming out. I had a very small hand in ghost writing for her a little bit, in the first draft. So I use a lot of the early chapters from that book still, in management. And I still recommend the tactics in there, so I'm excited for her to get it out.
Lenny :
Wow. I've been hearing about ghost writing as a career recently, and it feels like it could be an option for you down the road.
Lenny :
I'm excited to read the book. I haven't gotten a copy yet. I think you could pre-order it now, and we'll link to it in the show notes.
Eeke de Milliano :
Nice.
Lenny :
What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to, other than maybe the one you're on right now?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah, this one's great. I can't choose between these two, though. One is Lex Fridman. And then the other is EconTalk by Russ Roberts. I really like that both of them are... Their agenda is curiosity, which I love.
Lenny :
Totally resonate there. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've enjoyed?
Eeke de Milliano :
Is it too basic to say White Lotus?
Lenny :
Cool. That's the most mentioned one, which says a lot, right? That just says how good that is, because I love it too. But, that works. Season one or season two?
Eeke de Milliano :
Oh, season two, all the way.
Lenny :
Yeah, same. I'm excited for season three. No spoilers. Favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?
Eeke de Milliano :
To what do you attribute your success? And you can't say luck.
Lenny :
Interesting. Because most people look for, do they believe it's luck, versus their innate skill? So you don't even allow them to say luck? Interesting.
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. Because I think humble people will always say luck in some way. And I always kind of wanted to know, "How self aware are you, and how curious are you?"
Eeke de Milliano :
And I think people who have really gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today, really says a lot about how they think about the world.
Lenny :
I love that. What are some SaaS tools that you love, or use often, at your current company, or anywhere else?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. Well, first and foremost, it's Retool. And then, the other SaaS tools that we use a lot, Slack, Gong, Linear and FullStory.
Lenny :
Awesome. Favorite new product that you found, maybe in life, maybe at work?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yeah. Have you heard of Rewind?
Lenny :
Yes, I have it running right now.
Eeke de Milliano :
Nice. Yeah. I mean, I think it's really incredible what they've done.
Lenny :
Maybe describe it briefly, just so folks know what that is.
Eeke de Milliano :
It basically records everything that you're doing on your computer and then makes it really easy for you to search it. Which, it's just incredible. I don't know if you work this way, Lenny. But I feel like nowadays, I don't really go to tabs anymore. I kind of directly search for the thing that I'm searching for. And I think Rewind just fits that user behavior so, so well.
Lenny :
Amazing. Eeke, this was so much fun. We got through everything I was hoping for, and more.
Lenny :
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, see what you're up to? And, how can listeners be useful to you?
Eeke de Milliano :
Definitely find me online on Twitter. It's @EekeDM. And, how can they help us? Try out the Retool product and give us some feedback.
Lenny :
Amazing. Retool.com, right?
Eeke de Milliano :
Yes.
