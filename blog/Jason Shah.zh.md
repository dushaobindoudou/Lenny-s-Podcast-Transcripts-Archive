## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### I see it at Alchemy all the time. I see an engineer hop in and fix something at 3

00 AM because they feel committed to the code base, and it's not a thousand-person engineering organization where my only job is to make the iOS app 2% more effective at engaging users.
Lenny :
So, you touched on the skill of pushing back on a founder or CEO, and I know that's something you're really good at. I've seen you do this. I'm curious what you've learned about how to effectively do that as a PM at a company pushing back on a CEO or founder when you disagree.
Jason Shah :
I mean, I think...

**Yeah, it's a great question, and to briefly recap, right, I've gotten to see somebody like David Sachs who've been the CEO of PayPal and then the founder of Yammer and gone to do many more things since then. I've gotten to see sort of Jeff Bezos at a distance. I was never that close to him obviously and never got to work with him, but got to observe his impact on the organization. Obviously, I've gotten to witness Brian Chesky and his leadership in sort of the pre-IPO days as well as through the ups and downs of COVID, and then also now at Alchemy, our co-founders, Joe and Nikil are leaders that have really had an impact on me as well, and I would count myself, but I've also see myself as a bad leader in the start of [inaudible 00**:

29:56] and learn from that.
Jason Shah :
I think it's a really important thing to reflect on, and I think for me there are three things that have stood out the most. I think number one, nothing is above them. I've seen whether it's Brian caring about the full bleed image on the homepage, whether it's Jeff Bezos who famously would receive customer emails, read many of them, forward them, and he's famous for question mark emails where for his time's sake he would just forward an email to a leader with a question mark and you would just have to figure it out and then report back in 24 hours with the resolution thereof. But nothing's above them, and a lot of founders or a lot of CEOs or even CPOs and leaders think you get to a certain point and then I'm above a product spec, I'm above looking at the data running a sequel query, and I think that that is a mistake in a lot of ways, especially from a standpoint of who people come to respect as well as efficacy at one's job.
Jason Shah :
And then the other two things would be, I think they're in the details. So, it's less about being above something, but this is kind of Amazon's famous for auditing the details for example, and leaders are... For example, when we were going to launch Prime, order a bunch of Prime things and see what happens and really test things out, and write up a long feedback email on Saturday or something like that, and make sure that things are moving forward.
Jason Shah :
So, I think in my opinion, some of the best leaders, David Sachs would do this too. He actually ran the product reviews. It was the CEO of the company doing product reviews, not some kind of middle tier of a director of product who was just running them. They were force involved and there were things to delegate and activate around, but Sachs was in all of those details and ran those product reviews himself and would talk to the product managers directly, and I think that was really impactful, and it also, I think from an accountability and culture perspective, when you're PM and you talk to the CEO and you feel like you're presenting something at product review, it's totally different, and it creates a certain amount of responsibility and quality, frankly, that I think is really important, and it's a way to coach obviously as well for those leaders to really make a mark on the organization.
Jason Shah :
And then lastly, I think they adapt, right? I think that are a lot of leaders who are like, "I've worked 20 years to become a leader in this way and I have a playbook," either based on past experience or based on some sort of philosophy that they've developed over time that they feel committed to in some way, and I think coming back to some of these examples of watching Brian lead through COVID or watching Joe and Nikil now through this particular crypto winter shift gears and figure out exactly like we're still building the core business, but how else can we lean into this and adapt to the unique opportunities that are in front of us. I think that's really powerful. So, what I've seen is nothing is above them, they're in the details, and they adapt to new information and new situations. That's what I've seen the most that I've appreciated in the best leaders that I've gotten to either observe or work closely with.
Lenny :
Awesome. That's super interesting. The first two are kind of connected which is really interesting, and it just reminds me of Brian and how detail-oriented he was about everything. He used to review every product launch and every screen of every new product. We had to show him here's what we're launching this week, and he just kind of went through and either blew it up or let it pass. And then I just remember the founders, when they were designing the office space, just looking at pictures of listings they wanted to... Because Airbnb, the office conference rooms were modeled after Airbnb listings, and Jim just looking through hundreds of listings that the team brought him and he'd just picked the ones that he wanted to turn into conference rooms. Also, obviously Steve Jobs. This is a really interesting through line of great leaders is just this huge attention to detail, and there's probably something about once they let go that thing start to kind of diminish. Is that what you find?
Jason Shah :
Yeah, that's such a great point. You mentioned the Jobs example and there's a great book that you've probably read or in your community seen, I believe it's called Creative Selection by Ken Kocienda about the early days of the iPhone, and I think it was Project Purple or something like that, and you're absolutely right. There wasn't no slides, none of this. They brought in the prototypes for each of those reviews and things like how to do typing on a tiny screen and those early keyboards and how to do auto complete, and Jobs was totally in those details from Ken's telling in this book.
Jason Shah :
So, I couldn't agree with you more, and it's something that people miss because most of their exposure to leaders is on a YouTube video or at all hands, and so, they don't really get to see that side of leaders I think, and it's also not what I think from an ego perspective is kind of what people want it to be about. They want to be about making big decisions or commanding a large group of people, and I think it's hard to do that without these pieces.
Jason Shah :
One other thing I just wanted to briefly touch on to your point on how they're connected, it's a really good point, and at the surface it almost seems like they could potentially be the same thing. One thing worth calling out though I think is the idea of something not being above somebody or a person not being above things. I think the biggest thing I take away from that is humility is that nothing is not my job, right? Anything, could be picking up paper off the floor and putting it in the trash, or it could be reviewing a product spec, whatever it is, and then begin the details in my opinion is about craft, right, and really understanding things at a low level such that you're able to reason about it and make good decisions, like Brian with the homepage or Bezos in some cases with customer processes that he got in the weeds on. I think the two together, humility and being excellent at craft, I think is a very potent combination, especially when you throw in the last thing of being able to adapt to any situation.
Lenny :
That's really interesting. What it also makes me think about is the reason things are less good often if there isn't a person at the top that's being very detail-oriented, and I find this with the newsletter and this podcast and other stuff is no one's going to care as much about it. No one's going to be like, "Oh my god, I really need to get this right so much because I'm just like, I'm personally feeling responsible for the quality of this stuff and it's like it's on my shoulders to make this awesome." And so, I think that's probably why a lot of the best stuff is led by a singular leader or singular opinion or singular person. A lot of the best startups are just someone's vision is like, "Here, this is what we're going to do," and then the more it becomes a community-driven thing, the less often it ends up being successful.
Lenny :
This episode is brought to you by Maven. I've been an investor, an advisor, and a customer of Maven from day one. I even taught my product management course through Maven. Maven is a cohort-based learning platform where you learn alongside peers with a direct connection to your instructor. Maven's got a ton of courses for product managers, founders, and executives to help them level up in all kinds of ways. Over 10,000 people from Airbnb to Coinbase to Google to Tesla have taken courses from real experts and operators that have spent decades honing their craft. As part of their fall season which Maven just launched, there are over 100 new courses starting in the next few weeks. Many of the people I've had on this podcast are teaching courses like Jackie Bavaro on product strategy, Arielle Jackson on startup branding, Emily Kramer on B2B marketing, plus Annie Duke on decision-making, Nir Eyal on behavioral design and how to break into product management with Marily Nika. Check out all of my favorite courses and learn more at maven.com/lenny.
Jason Shah :
I feel like you're totally right, especially, I mean this is the natural progression, but it doesn't have to be that way right? And I think to your point, I think a lot of leaders focus on accountability in an organization once they get large, and so, you see things like performance reviews and things like this. It's a very top-down approach to trying to drive results, but is opposed to a sense of accountability if you drove a sense of responsibility. If people felt like this is my company too, this is my product, this is my office floor. I don't want trash on the floor. I'm going to pick it up and throw it there. Even if we have somebody whose job it supposedly is to clean that up, it's like I take pride of ownership in this and I'm connected to it, and I think that makes all the difference in terms of... At Airbnb, I think people who felt that way were willing to push back on certain things, or they're willing to propose new ideas because they felt invested in the company.
Jason Shah :

**I see it at Alchemy all the time. I see an engineer hop in and fix something at 3**:

00 AM because they feel committed to the code base, and it's not a thousand-person engineering organization where my only job is to make the iOS app 2% more effective at engaging users.
Lenny :
So, you touched on the skill of pushing back on a founder or CEO, and I know that's something you're really good at. I've seen you do this. I'm curious what you've learned about how to effectively do that as a PM at a company pushing back on a CEO or founder when you disagree.
Jason Shah :
I mean, I think this is one of... I actually think it's one of the most misunderstood terms in a sense because I think language like we were talking about earlier is so important, and yet what you call something ends up defining I think 90% of what people understand about a concept, right? And so, pushback is, I couldn't imagine a word more viscerally that makes you feel like you're sort physically going against what somebody else wants, and it gears people into a mindset of then, well, how should I push back. It starts from a place of I need to disagree, I need to say no. It's a very negative mindset, purely based on the word that has come to label a behavior that alternatively could be about how do I shift the direction on something, or how do I help the business actually succeed when I disagree with somebody about something, and that's a very different mindset.
Jason Shah :
And so, the two things that I've seen be most successful would be, I think number one is actually understanding what a goal is or what somebody's kind of issue is with something, and then actually aligning those things in some way. So, in coming back to Airbnb, I remember Airbnb had bought a company, Luxury Retreats. There was a goal to integrate that business and that product into the full Airbnb suite, and there was a lot of potential with that, but I remember that there was part of the product experience that was oriented around chatting with somebody and the idea that the business had had a very large team of wonderful people who helped you as concierges basically for your trip, and so, this was a team that I was on that, to be honest, had fairly low morale. It's always difficult to integrate an acquisition with a company, especially when we were based in different places, et cetera.
Jason Shah :
I remember hearing from a leader who had been at Airbnb for a while who's very effective at persuading senior leadership, and they understood why this was a problem because this chat product was growing in complexity. You'd have to build all these features into it, and nobody could successfully shift the direction, and as a result, it was just this... It was a mess as a result, and there was very low morale because we were taking on too much scope, people weren't sure it was the right product, it was being built up as one giant launch as opposed to an iterative thing. And what was really interesting was that this leader was very effective at understanding that the goal wasn't about building a bunch of features. It was about, as often discussed at Airbnb, a magical experience.
Jason Shah :
And so, when we took a step back, it was reimagined as trip designers, not concierges, and their goal was to design your trip, and part of that meant a very elegant, simple chat experience so that you could have a efficient, fast, positive experience with that trip designer and move on. And it shifted the pushback of like, "We can't build this thing, it's too many features, we don't have enough time, we don't have enough resources" to, "Oh, we all want a really elegant, really smooth, slick experience for our customers. How do we do that? What's a trip design or a new concept that is actually going to elevate things? We're not telling you we want a payback scope. We're not saying we want to settle for less. We're actually just not only going to call it something different, but also envision a simpler experience which is more elegant. It's more on brand with luxury."
Jason Shah :
Boom, all of a sudden, everybody gets what they want. It's a better customer experience, less scope, and it wasn't about saying no. It was about understanding what we're all actually sharing as a goal which was a great simple customer experience and then actually building that. So, I saw that to be really effective and I think that that's something I try to bring into my career. I have a couple other examples if it's useful, but that was a big one that I learned from Airbnb.
Lenny :
Yeah, another example would be great. One thought there though is do you think it was mostly the name and the concept or was it that it was a bigger idea? What do you think it was about reframing it that way that got people, "Oh wow, okay, now I'm really excited about it again"?
Jason Shah :
That's a great point. I think it was a big idea, right, with a good reframing, and I think it's like many things where there's the substance of something and then there's the communication of it. And so, this is true often, for example, if a company is changing strategy. Oftentimes people might walk away feeling like, "Yeah, I guess I kind of agree with the strategy, but the way was communicated was really poor," or vice versa, like, "Yeah, they told us in advance and they sat us down all hands, but I really disagree with this strategy and I'm going to be dug into my heels and not disagree and commit now."
Jason Shah :
So, in this case, I think you're totally right. If it was just window dressing of... Founders are too smart, especially at all these companies we've talked about, to be fooled with a simple renaming of something. But I think the combination of a bigger idea, more exciting idea that was at the heart of what we were all going after together, combined with a simple way of communicating it because I've also seen big ideas that are poorly communicated fall flat on their face and not achieve the intended outcome. Those two together, I think were a really potent combination.
Lenny :
Awesome. I'd love to hear another example.
Jason Shah :
Yeah, for sure. So, a recent example at Alchemy actually, right? We're growing, we're hiring, but there are a lot of roles, especially being in Web3 that are not yet created. For example, there's traditionally growth, product growth marketing, we've created new area around growth operations which I'd be happy to talk about if we want to get into it. But it's a really interest interesting area, and we were going back and forth on should we hire for this role, it's not even a real thing. We've looked at some candidates, we're not so sure about them. And when I realize with our founders who are incredibly smart, very talented, have built the company over so many years now, they want to win. That's what they care about at the end of the day. They are so driven to win at the end of the day.
Jason Shah :
And so, ultimately, it wasn't like, "Let me make some rational argument about the role of growth operations or let me defend some issues with this person's resume that maybe you're spotting when we make this hiring decision," but, "Oh, you want to win? Oh, we want to grow faster? Awesome. This is the way to do it, and that's how we're going to actually become the generational company we want to be." Again, a reframing in this case around, yeah, we might disagree or squabble about certain things at a detail level, but I understand what we all came here to do and let's focus on that and how this is a part of that versus just focusing on maybe the means to an end versus the end itself, and the end always brings a lot of clarity in my experience.
Lenny :
What's cool about both these examples, and another guest touched on this, when you're trying to influence the CEO or the founder, coming back to your working backwards concept, you almost want to work backwards from what are they excited about, how do they see the world, what's important to them, and then pitch it that way. So, in the first example, I imagine they were pitching to Brian and he's like, "Yeah, drip design, that sounds like something Brian would love." Then in the second example, "Yeah, we're going to win. Here's how we win." So, that's a really interesting takeaway there.
Jason Shah :
I mean, I think we all forget that we're all just humans, and at the end of the day, we all are busy, et cetera. It reminds me of a lot of sales, right? I was very unsuccessful when I was trying to do outbound sales in the early days of my last startup do.com because I didn't understand this. I'm a product person. I'm not a sales person. I didn't listen to what people cared about. I didn't kind of work backwards from what a CRO or head of people that we might have been selling to cared about. I was just about features and here's what we can do for you and this and that. But all they cared about were one or two things, right? Maybe the CRO's growing revenue. Maybe the head of peoples worried about culture or scaling their talent organization, and we were nowhere near that list.
Jason Shah :
And so, I think it's similar for CEOs, and there's a huge disconnect when say a PM walks into a meeting with the CEO and they're talking about something that CEO is 10 miles away from thinking about, and certainly even the mindset that they're bringing to the conversation is totally different. I think Casey made a lot of great points about this in the recent podcast as well.
Lenny :
Sweet. Casey Winters, podcast plug. Okay, so something else that you're really good at is you don't kind of focus career-wise on working your way up the ladder and being like the top PM, and you seem to be really good at kind of following with what's interesting to you and your interest and your curiosity. Is there something that you've learned there, something you could share for folks that are just like, "Oh my gosh, should I just keep in with this job and work my way up? Should I try something new?" What have you learned about that sort of thinking?
Jason Shah :
There's the framework I like is ladder versus map, and I think that you can be either person that any point in your life. Sometimes there's a bit of a set mindset that somebody might have one way or another, but I like ladder versus map. Ladder is about moving up. It's more influence, more power, a higher title, things like this, whereas map is I just want to go wherever's interesting, right? I literally think of it, I think of my career very similar to travel. I want to go to Greece. I want to be hungry, walking around in India, sweating in a hundred degree weather. I want to go to Australia and kind of get locked out of my hotel and see what that's like.
Jason Shah :
I'm okay with discomfort because it's interesting. Sometimes, for better or worse, maybe this is a privilege, it's certainly a privileged thing to say, but I care more about living a really interesting life than let's say a good or comfortable life. I think that's where the growth comes from. That's where the stories come from. That's to me the things that I'll remember the most.
Jason Shah :
And so, when I think about product and I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to care about the products I built and how they affected people. Nobody's really going to be looking at my LinkedIn, hopefully for their sake and mine, at my funeral. Sorry, it's a very morbid analogy, but I think thinking of the future provides a lot of clarity about what am I going to care about a long time from now, and I think that applies to all facets of life. That's how I thought about my life partner. That's how I think about my career. That's how I think about where I want to live, San Francisco. San Francisco, a lot of people like to talk negatively about it, but I believe in the community. I believe in the place I'm interested in the long term, even if you know the short term it has some challenges to it.
Jason Shah :
So, I personally believe really strongly in this kind of ladder versus map distinction, and I think a lot of people are very intentional in the micro. They think about their next job, their next title, how much salary and equity there is. In good ways too, they think about the team that they're going to work on next with, but they're very unintentional about the macro. What's the big picture? What do I care about as an individual? There's not a lot of classes for that. There's not a lot of blog posts in the product management field about the touchy-feely side of this, and who are you as a person, where do you get energy from. So, for me, I found that really clarifying and it makes career decisions that have seemed risky to other people seem inevitable to me.
Lenny :
Is there a story of or example of how you use this approach to make a decision at where you end up going, and/or or is there something that you maybe regret or are really happy with in terms of the kind of the fork in the road, looking back, using this way of thinking?
Jason Shah :
A few concrete examples, actually. I'll keep them brief though. One is when I first moved to San Francisco, and I had mentioned I did a small sale of that education company, and I could have done a lot of more productive things with my career in the short term. I had all my peers from college who had gone off to their great jobs at Google or whatever. I said, "I'm looking to move to San Francisco and work at my dining table, and I have a little bit of savings from this, so why not? Let's see. It's going to be super interesting." I mean, it was also very boring at times, and so, I didn't want a lot on the sort of micro level, but I built five or six products. I became much better at programming as a result.
Jason Shah :
I remember one time, it's kind of a goofy story, but I was working at my dining table, and I saw Ron Conway on the street. I was disheveled because I was just working from my apartment and I wanted to go pitch Ron Conway on this terrible idea for a startup, and so went out there, and maybe it was fortunate to not shove me to the side, and he listened to me for a minute and then I emailed him after. These are random things that happen that over time I think make us who we are. Are you the sort of person who's going to hustle and do that? When I was building that education company, I went and put flyers in people's cars in various high schools, and I was trying to get things started, and coming back to leadership, that would be below most people. It's like, "Wait, you own a company and you're sticking flyers in people's windshields?" It was like, "What's wrong with you?"
Jason Shah :
So, anyway, I think that was an example of time where it was like, "Okay, if I'm on the ladder," I'm like, "I got to get the best entry-level job or whatever." Even if I had been an entrepreneur before that, I would've thought about my structure in my career, and I was more like, "This is going to be interesting. I'll figure it out. I believe in myself enough that I'll figure it out." So, I did that. Yammer and leaving Yammer was similar where I could have stayed. My equity was finally worth something. I could have learned a lot even I'm sure from the Microsoft structure, but I was bored and I had been talking to a couple angel investors who were willing to put money into whatever the thing was going to be, and I felt like raising money's actually going to be really hard for me. This is going to make my life a lot easier and I can focus on product and so on and so forth.
Jason Shah :
That was a really hard four years. Things like an M&A offer falling through the day before your wedding, or chewing glass and submitting to the Apple iStore and being a featured app and then resubmitting because we wanted to fix a bug, and then actually now it crashes 90% of the time. It's Memorial Day weekend and you can't get in touch with the Apple business development manager who can help you out to reapprove something. It was a really stressful four years, but using the map analogy, that's like getting lost in Croatia and having to find your way out or getting lost to to your hotel in Australia or getting bitten by a dog in Thailand, which actually did happen to me. But these are interesting experiences that I think build characters.
Jason Shah :
So, I'll pause there, but I think there are a lot of career decisions I've made. Do I have regrets? At times, for sure because you see what would've happened if you had joined a different company at that time and it would've been like, "Oh, I would've met so many great people. I would've worked on these products. I mean, my equity would've been worth more," whatever. But I think you only lived once, and I think that these rare experiences have been very true to me and taught me things that I wouldn't learn otherwise.
Lenny :
What's really cool about that analogy, ladder versus map, is a lot of times you think you're climbing a ladder and you think it's innately going to be great, and sometimes that ladder falls over and the company doesn't go anywhere and/or the job sucks, your ladder's heading to some terrible place. And what I find in my experience is anytime I try something totally new and take a risk, especially following things that give me energy, and I'm just like, "Let's just take a leap on this thing," in my experience at least, it's always led to better opportunities and much more interesting work. And so, it's kind of this get off the ladder to get on a different ladder, and sometimes you think you're on a nice ladder and it's not going to get you anywhere anyway. So, explore other ladders. So, I'm kind of picturing a Chutes and Ladders.
Jason Shah :
Totally.
Lenny :
There's many ladders and you want to explore the different ladders across the map. How about that?
Jason Shah :
I mean, I think you're totally right, and the only brief thing I would add to the way that you put it which I think captures the essence here is I think we all have a lot of false precision about what we think a given career move is going to lead to or what it's going to be like, and we forget that a lot of career decisions are made out of maybe 10 hours cumulatively talking to a team and getting signals.
Jason Shah :
So, I think that that false precision sometimes gives us comfort in making certain decisions and folds us back from a bolder decision that might be better, but maybe the ladder is just hidden behind some fog if you really want that, and you can get both. Maybe you can go to the most interesting place in the world, and have the success in life and progress and so on and so forth. It's just that I think a lot of people think it's totally either/or. They think that they've already figured out the precise outcome that's going to happen, and to your point, the ladder often does fall over. If that's what all your hopes are pinned on, it's a very fragile career decision I think is really difficult to navigate.
Lenny :
The flip side, you also don't want to be bouncing around over and over and over. As much as I talked about how I shifted and tried new things, I'm a very serial monogamous in terms of work. My first job, I was there nine years, then a startup for a year and a half, and then Airbnb for seven years, and then what I'm doing now may be forever. And so, there's a lot of value to sticking around and kind of seeing things through. And so, I guess, I don't know if you'll have an answer to this, but do you have any wisdom on when to stick with it and keep exploring opportunities at a place you're at versus trying something new?
Jason Shah :
My hope is that there's a balance here in the sense that the map shouldn't give the impression of 180 countries, let's do 180 tech companies and shorten the tenure from two years down to a month, and we've just created a generation of job hoppers which is even easier because we're all on Zoom. It's a good point and I really respect people like you who have stuck it out through the ups and the downs and somebody sees seven years on paper, but I mean, seven years, I don't know. How many chapters of Airbnb, how many crises moments?
Lenny :
Felt like 300.
Jason Shah :
There you go. So, I think there's a balance, right? For example, I want to be in Web3 for more than a decade. I want to stay at Alchemy for a very long time and help build the company. So, I guess when I think of map, maybe an important way to think about it is maybe when somebody is 50 or 60 or 70 and they might choose to stop working, a lot of people when they start their career actually have 30 years to play with or 40 years or 50 if they're lucky. That's a lot of chips you can play. You could do five, 10 year rounds, right? And so, I think that in terms of sticking it out, maybe I'm biased, I think that some of the absolute sort gems, if you will, in Silicon Valley and tech are the teammates that are willing to stay around for 4, 5, 6, 7 years, and they have institutional knowledge that nobody has. They have a positive impact on the culture that is impossible if there's constant employee turnover.
Jason Shah :
So, to me, I think that you could simultaneously be somebody who's committed to companies, stays for a very meaningful amount of time, but zooms out and looks at their career. Actually, I think maybe this was even more, right? You're now a famous podcaster. You were a successful startup founder. You were a product leader. All these things form a map and I think a really interesting career and life, frankly, that's pretty full with a lot of really interesting milestones and learnings and networks and people that you get to interact with.
Lenny :
Yeah. To your point about how long a career is, when I thought about it recently, this is my fourth career. First it was an engineer, then it was a founder, then a product manager when I got to Airbnb, and now this weird thing that I do, and there's so much time to explore and try new things. I will say though, I feel like the early things you do seem really important. Airbnb for me was not early, so maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like you want to work at a company where people look at that on your resume and are like, "Oh, okay, this person's probably good." So, I feel like there's that piece you got to get right at some point.
Jason Shah :
Yeah, I totally agree with that. For example, I think for let's say a new grad who's thinking about a product career, and let's say on the spectrum there is maybe Goldman Sachs because that's what a lot of people are doing. They're like, "Yeah, I want to do product, but I also feel like I need this gold star or whatever." And then in between is you could join a hypergrowth company of some sort where they definitely have good product people you can learn from, but definitely still room for you to do more than what a very junior person would be assigned to be doing. And then on the other end of the spectrum is I'm going to have no job, I'm just going to completely bounce around from my own projects or just work with a new startup every two months.
Jason Shah :
Personally in that spectrum, I tend to be more towards the middle of that where build a track record, build a network. I mean, it's crazy. Even just this week, next week I'm seeing maybe five people that I know from my Yammer days, and to your point on formative nature, some of those people, that's how I learned how to do product. That's how I learned things like AB testing. It's how I had the first angel investors in my next company. That's how I hire. I still hire people, maybe much to their chagrin, they still get LinkedIn messages for me trying to push them for the next thing.
Jason Shah :
So, I totally agree that those early days are really formative, and there's maybe a balance between nobody wants to be a job hopper, but at the same time maybe there's ways to also not just be a career person who spends kind of 30 years working up the ladder or is fixated on I need to be CPO but is willing to give up a director title to go be a hustler at some startup because they really believe in it and they want to take a bet or risk in their career.
Lenny :
You touched on hiring, and that's something I wanted to ask you. So, you're in my Talent Collective. You're a company that's hiring, Alchemy, and I was looking at the stats recently, and you're one of the most successful companies at getting candidates to talk to you, and generally I think you're just really good at hiring. So, I'm curious what you can share with folks about hiring.
Jason Shah :
I appreciate that, and I get a lot of value out of meeting some really talented people from the Collective. I think hiring, it's funny, it reminds me of sort of push back in a sense of what you call it has such an impact on how people think about it. It's hiring, recruiting, but if people reframe it as the people you are going to work with every day or the people who make the company what it is, it shifts the mindset. It's like how is that not the most important thing to be thinking about as a leader or as a founder. A lot of people have benchmarks. I think maybe on the Google podcast I talk about 30%, 40% of a founder's time maybe spent on recruiting because I think deep down everybody understands that that's incredibly valuable.
Jason Shah :
I think that for me personally, I was reflecting ahead of the podcast on how I approach things now after different stages of hiring, and for context, for what it's worth, I've been at the zero person startup. It's just me and I'm trying to convince some Google engineer to come join us which is incredibly hard and has a low hit rate, to a place like Amazon or Airbnb where you have a large world-class recruiting organization that is effectively doing sourcing for you and setting up interviews and such things like this, and there's formal calibrations and interview panels, to a place like Alchemy where it's very sort of scrappy. We need to figure out who we even want to hire. The founders still meet with every candidate. It's a really different environment.
Jason Shah :
So, this is kind of the spectrum that I've seen, and I was reflecting what do I think works the best, and I like to think of it in very similar motions to a business where I think there is a marketing aspect to it, there was a sales aspect, and there is a product aspect to it. What I mean by that is that on a marketing level, I think what has a person heard about your company. Do they know anybody who works there? Do they read your LinkedIn post about things and already know that you're a known quantity before they even step in the door to interview? Are they even willing to interview based on what they know about the company? And so, I think that the marketing aspect in it, and I mean it's sort of lower case marketing in this sense of course because I think a hard sell of any sort or anything that's not authentic is probably going to fail ultimately, but it's about developing a really positive kind of brand and reputation for a company but also as an individual.
Jason Shah :
And then if you pass that threshold, I feel like there's a sort of a sales process, and we were talking about how bad of a salesperson I am, for example, because I didn't listen to people's pain points and understand the one or two things that were most important to them. I think similarly in this context, if they're an engineer, do they want to work in a world-class engineering organization? If they're a product person or they're just really excited about crypto and they want to find a way in, a place like Alchemy's the best place for them to learn that is how to think about it, and it's not about misdirecting on or matching whatever they say, but it's about really understanding who they are and what motivates them and what they're excited about because I'm as concerned about the kind of post-hiring step as I am the pre-hiring and want them to work out and be happy and be effective.
Jason Shah :
And then lastly, I think there's a product angle to it that not a lot of people think about or talk about a lot because I think the product, it's one of those rare cases where job descriptions are almost like product specs, right? They're here's what the responsibilities are, here's what we need you to do, here's the qualifications we're looking for. And what's really funny about that is that product is very iterative, but somehow we just write a job description, and then it's bait, it's done, it's posted, and nobody thinks about it again until the person's hired and then they take it down.
Jason Shah :
I think taking a product mindset where I meet people all the time now where I don't really know exactly what role they're necessarily going to fill, I'm not really sure about exactly their seniority, maybe they don't have a lot of experience, but maybe they would just totally be a rockstar on our product team. And looking at a product that we can mold flexibly and think of the same way if at Airbnb, if we were going to build Airbnb Plus, if we just kind of came back to the Amazon working backwards and just wrote a document and it was over, that's one thing, but we didn't do that, right? We went and actually built rooms and homes that were supposed to be Airbnb Plus, and then we iterate on it and we changed the pillows and we changed the entrance and we changed the scent that you feel when you walk in. We coach host and learned about that.
Jason Shah :
So, I think a product mindset on hiring and iterating on it based on the candidates you're meeting, the needs of the business. So this kind of marketing, sales, product combination has been what I've found to be really effective at getting people excited, understanding who they are and what they need, and then crafting a role that actually makes the person successful, rather than just checks a box in your recruiting software as some new headcount that was hired.
Lenny :
One last question before we get to our lightning round. For PMs that are listening to this maybe early in their career, what skill have you found to be most important in helping you and helping PMs in general advance in their career?
Jason Shah :
Yeah, this is a really important question, like the others, but I think that understanding and defining what problem matters is the most important skill that I think I've taken away, and it applies to so many things. It can apply to a specific product we're building. It can apply to what a company's mission is. I think I've found it really effective because it affects pretty much everything. It affects what we're going to build. It affects is the team motivated by what we're doing. So, specifically for example, at a place like Alchemy where, yeah, we're a developer platform, but should we build an SDK so there's abstraction that is easier for developers to use? Should we build an NFT API because we think that's a really important stack to move into and an important use case to support?
Jason Shah :
Well, the question is what problem are we solving? It's not this versus that just in a vacuum. It's is the problem developer experienced and we want to make things easier to develop. Is the problem that an NFT marketplace, a whole suite of them are trying to grow and need more support from us, and not understanding these problems clearly? And it goes back to my first company. It was an education company, and the problem was that low-income students didn't have access to the same resources to get into college as other students, and that guided everything. That guided the pricing model which was basically free for a long time, and then we monetize on sponsorships from colleges, right? The problem matter, whereas the problem solve was there's not a... A different problem was there's just no good college readiness program. Fine, then you focus manically on the pedagogy and the curriculum and so on and so forth, rather than say the business model and an initial product that you think can work.
Jason Shah :
So, that's what I've found to be the most useful, and I can give her other examples if it's helpful, but understanding what problem we're actually trying to solve and really getting crystal clear about it, I think has been incredibly useful to me and energizing as well.
Lenny :
It's such a good reminder, even though it's such a cliche of product managers being, "Well, what problem are we trying to solve here?" People hate that, but Michael Paul, and I mentioned this on a different podcast too, he makes this point that when you do drugs sometimes, you have these epiphanies that you come out and you're like, "Love is all you need, man." It's like, okay, yep. But it feels so right. You really feel it. The reason that it's such a cliche is because people have found it to be so true for so long that it's annoying now, but it also tells you how true it is. And so, I think it's a really good reminder of yes, it's annoying to ask that question, and people make fun of PMs for that, but that's because it's so damn important.
Jason Shah :
Just a brief kind of additional, what you share there, I mean, I completely agree. I think it's very true in life, right? It's like, well, what matters? And it's like, well, your health, your family, your sense of purpose. It's like nobody's unfamiliar with the answer, but like most things, it's about the application of it and about the nuance of it, and I think that's what product is ultimately sort of all about too.
Lenny :
Awesome. Are you ready for our lightning round where I'm just going to ask you five quick questions, tell me what comes to mind and we'll have some fun. Does that sound good?
Jason Shah :
That sounds great. Ready.
Lenny :
Okay, cool. I think I'm going to start adding music to these things. I got to figure that out. For now, no music. Okay. What book do you recommend most to other PMs?
Jason Shah :
The Hard Thing About Hard things.
Lenny :
Can you add why?
Jason Shah :
I think it teaches product managers to chew glass and care about outcomes the way that a CEO has to, and I think that's a really useful mindset to have.
Lenny :
Man, this chew glass metaphor, I don't like the sound of that.
Jason Shah :
I saw you cringe. I was a little worried about that.
Lenny :
Oh my god. What a great job we have here, chewing glass. Okay. Other than Alchemy, what's a company you recommend most to PMs to go look for new gigs if they're looking around?
Jason Shah :
I would suggest Polygon, Salon, or MoonPay. I know it's three, but I wanted to give some breath in the Web3 space that might be exciting to people.
Lenny :
Great, great choices. What's a favorite TV show or movie that you've recently watched?
Jason Shah :
The Ken Burns Vietnam War series. I'm really into documentaries and history, and it's a really kind of compelling version of history that I've never seen before.
Lenny :
Awesome. Love that. Okay. Favorite interview question that you like to ask.
Jason Shah :
What is a risk you regret not taking, why, and what did you learn about yourself?
Lenny :
What do you look for in an answer there?
Jason Shah :
I think the biggest thing I look for is a growth mindset, to be able to reflect on an experience like that and be vocally self-critical without unproductively being hard on one's self, and I think that the dimension of asking about risk gets at their psychology and how do they think about not only their career, but if they were to work with me, how would they approach problem solving and taking bets on the business.
Lenny :
Awesome. Okay, final question. What's your least favorite vegetable?
Jason Shah :
Broccoli. I just removed some from a pizza last night that I really didn't want to eat.
Lenny :
Wow. Oh wow, okay. Even like steamed, cook, all the things?
Jason Shah :
There are no circumstances under which I'm excited about broccoli.
Lenny :
Oh man, you got to eat those veggies.
Jason Shah :
I know. I'm working on it.
Lenny :
Okay, Jason, this was amazing. Lived up to what I was hoping our second episode would be. Definitely better than our first which we'll leave on the cutting room floor. Two last questions. Where can people find you online? I assume Alchemy's hiring, so maybe pointing people there. And then how can listeners be useful to you?
Jason Shah :
Yeah, definitely. So, if you're interested in Alchemy and Web3, go to alchemy.com and click through to our jobs page from there. I'm online @0xShah. That is my crypto pseudonymous handle and happy to engage with folks there. And in terms of being helpful to me, I would love any feedback on anything that came up. I would love any products that people are working on. I also invest, and we also partner with a lot of products and teams at Alchemy, and I would love to meet anybody that's listening on the podcast too because I know Lenny's all about community and has kind of given so much back over the years that I would love to meet folks that are out there and get a chance to spend time talking about the products that you're all building.
Lenny :
Awesome. Thanks, Jason.
