Yeah. You're right that the team didn't discover the next Instagram. For what it's worth, things like Threads and ideas like Threads were in that team all of the time.

**Where someone's about to leave and they're like, "No, go work on this coal stuff over here in the fringe," which is really interesting. But just instill within the company and maybe help with that. Just keep people that are awesome at Meta. [inaudible 00**:

45:16].
Noam Lovinsky :
Yeah. You're right that the team didn't discover the next Instagram. For what it's worth, things like Threads and ideas like Threads were in that team all of the time. I think that if that team caught the wave of generative AI and all of the opportunities and new technologies there, I think things could have also... Because those are certain moments where you having small, really motivated, dedicated teams that aren't thinking about anything mainline can lead to faster discoveries, I think that can also help. But there were a number of things that basically ended up becoming features in other products and they were just easier, faster ways of validating and building them because you didn't have the constraints of the mainline product development organization, right?
Lenny :
For someone that is thinking about trying to create a startup within a startup, something a lot of big companies are trying to do, is there a piece of advice or two that you'd share for helping this be effective? Maybe one is just the goal may not be build the next big business. There's these sub goals also. What comes to mind?
Noam Lovinsky :
God, there's so many. Schrep did a really fantastic job of removing a lot of these constraints. So one is I would say think really hard about the incentive system. Smart, good people, even if they're not trying to, they end up kind of gaming things towards the incentive system. And so think long and hard about that. So for instance, if you're a large organization and you do some performance management process like twice a year and that's how you're going to evaluate and incentivize people in your 0 to 1 incubator, you've already killed it. It's the wrong incentive, it's the wrong timeframe. It creates adverse selection, problems for the sort of people that you bring in. And so it's hard in an existing organization to say, "We're going to take all these company processes around even how we level people and pay them and motivate them. And we're going to throw them out the window for this group."
:
How you build the infrastructure you use, this is something that the NP team did really well. Everyone got to do their own thing from an infrastructure perspective. Just do what is best for the problem you're trying to solve in this moment, knowing that you're likely going to throw away a lot of this code anyway. Being able to do that in an organization like Facebook or Google, if you ask anyone that works on those things, is really hard. It takes someone like a Schrep to be like, "Nope, they're going to get to do this. Sorry." And so I think that's really helpful.
:
For what it's worth, one of the organizations that we talked to that I felt like was doing this in one of the best ways was Nike. Nike has this incubation lab. It's a completely different operating model. They recruit a completely different type of person, very different incentive system. And essentially, where they end up plugging them into Nike is that when they have something into the distribution marketing kind of growth arms of Nike. But for the product discovery process, they're doing their whole different thing. Once they find some fit, then kind of Nike comes in and goes, "Boom. I'm going to help you explode your fit." But I think that the number one thing I would think about would be the incentive system and the adverse selection that that can cause.
Lenny :
To me, the most important element of the incentive system, and maybe I'm reading between the lines, is you're basically competing against them starting their own thing. And having upside if things go super well feels really important versus, "I'm just going to get a cool salary at Meta and work on this thing." That doesn't lead to the same experience as a startup where everything's on the line.
Noam Lovinsky :
Yeah. And also what time horizons, right? When you're starting a company, you're not thinking like, "In the next six months, I'm going to get a promo and I'm going to get a good rating and things are going to go well." You're thinking on a different, excuse me, time horizon, and you're thinking about an outsized impact or an outsized incentive. And so I would think about that if you're starting things internally as well.
Lenny :
Awesome. Okay. Let's move to the final bucket, Grammarly, which is where you're at now. The way I'm thinking about it is this kind of like a one, two rocket ship or I don't know, 10. It's further along than one, but that's where you're at now. To me, Grammarly is interesting because it's one of the very few successful B2C subscription businesses. There's almost none. There's Duolingo, Grammarly. And I know you're doing B2B also, but there's so few. There's so many dead bodies trying to build a business on top of consumer subscription. And so I'm just curious. What the current state of Grammarly? How are things going? What do you think has been the key to it being successful all this time and continuing to grow? And what lessons have you learned? I know you just joined relatively recently, but anything you've taken away from that journey so far?
Noam Lovinsky :
We don't talk about it often, but Grammarly is a much bigger company from a revenue perspective than I think people realize. The company has been around for 15 years and was profitable from day one, and continues to be quite profitable. So it's a very, very healthy business that is much larger than folks might realize. And that is actually quite intentional because the company was trying not to be noticed for a long time, very intentionally. The fact that you would have grammar and spell checking in Google Docs or grammar and spell checking in Word. People would often write off the company that like, "How is that a business? How is that a feature? These products already have it." And that was very convenient for Grammarly because they could kind of navigate between these giants in tech and grow a very phenomenal business on this use case that people had written off.
:
Now, come the advent of LMS, it's no longer a use case that people are writing off and sort of the dream of the founders that machines can assist us in communication in this way that they've had for 15 years, I feel like now the whole industry is like, "Well, this is obviously how we're going to communicate and machines are going to do all these things for us." And Grammarly is now sort of in the center of that hurricane. And again, I think it's a similar thing where it's like, "Well, there's ChatGPT. There's Microsoft Copilot. How is Grammarly going to have a chats?" But yet things still seem like there's the future. The future is bright.
:
And so to your question, I think what has made it work, I've only been here for 10 months so please kind of take this with a grain of salt, but my instinct is that people really love Grammarly because of how it works and where it works. And what I mean by how it works is Grammarly is one of the few products where you just install it and it makes you better. You don't have to configure it, you don't have to manipulate it, you don't have to change anything about what you're doing. You carry on and across all of your applications, across all of your tabs, you'll start getting pushed assistance to you in the right moment. You could ignore it if you want, no big deal, but it takes a very, very small amount of effort to tap on one of those things, get some value and keep going.
:
I think that a product that is that easy to use, that easy to extract value from, but then also that prevalent, how many different text boxes do you write in a given day? I mean, it is not less than 10, it is tens or potentially hundreds, right? And so it is everywhere and it is very, very low effort to get real value from it. And then the where we work is what I said, you don't have to change anything about your workflow. Grammarly meets you where you are and you get value from it. Doing that really well at this level of quality for a user base of this scale, essentially it's like a huge AI achievement masquerading as a little UX innovation, right? But that experience, that UX that sort of brings AI to the masses has obviously served Grammarly really well. I think those are some of the strengths that we're going to continue to lean on to now provide a very different type of assistance and value that we can because of where the technology has moved.
Lenny :
The other thing I've heard a lot about Grammarly, and Yuri was on the podcast and who led growth for a long time at Grammarly, is just how scrappy the business has been and the founders have been from the beginning, the fact that they've been profitable from the beginning. That feels like one of the threads through all of the successful consumer subscription companies, is super scrappy, not raising money for a long time. Is there anything there that you found to be really interesting or helpful for other folks that are maybe building the space?
Noam Lovinsky :
When you're a team that kind of starts out of Ukraine and you're not thinking that there's any chance that you're going to raise money and why would you do that, I mean it really... Back to our previous conversation of what happens when growth goes negative, it really forces you to focus on the important things. And so, like many of the early engineers who are still here because the company has done so well over the years, they think in like, "How is this work going to translate into revenue?" They think about the impact on the business from even very deep technical work that they're doing because I think they were brought up in this culture where the business doesn't really invest ahead of its profitability because it was a bootstrap business from day one. So that enforces everyone to think about their projects and their prioritization and how is what they're doing over the next two months going to actually turn into more revenue and keep the company growing and sustaining. So I think that culture is prevalent and help Grammarly get to where it is.
:
Now, I just want to be really honest that in moments that we're in like today, that can also be detrimental because the business gets to a certain size, you start getting to law of large numbers. You need to start thinking about are there other products? Are there other use cases? Are there other channels of growth? How do you invest ahead of some of that growth and start to diversify? Because at the scale and size that we are and aspire to be, we're going to have to do many more things and service many more different types of customers. And as you mentioned, we're going to have to pull off the motion of B2C to B, kind of get that product-led sales motion going. So all of those things are happening. And thankfully the business is as strong as it is where we can invest ahead now in those things while still maintaining profitability and a really strong business.
Lenny :
That's amazing that they're still team members and maybe I think you said engineers from the beginning, 12 years later. I think that says a lot about the business. And before we started recording, they're based in Ukraine and you were saying that they're going to Zooms, there's bombs going off, they have to go into bomb shelters and then jump on a meeting. It's incredible that team continues to operate and the business continues to do this well in spite of all that.
Noam Lovinsky :
Yeah, the team in Ukraine at Grammarly is... I mean, it's something else. It's a really fantastic team. When you speak to many of them, I think actually the work provides sometimes a very useful distraction, but they obviously feel a lot of pride in the business. They built a lot of this business. There aren't yet many businesses of this size that kind of come from Ukraine. I think that that team is incredible and continues to deliver a ton of impact to the company even in the circumstances that they're in. I know for the founders, a lot of why they want Grammarly to succeed and be the generational company that it can be is for Ukraine, and especially in this moment and it's awesome to see how that motivates them and 15 years on the same project is not nothing. That's some serious resilience. And so I think even in moments like that, using them as a way to motivate and strive for something greater I think says a lot about the founders and the team in Ukraine.
Lenny :
Absolutely. Hopefully there's a happy resolution soon there. I don't know if you know this, I was actually born in Ukraine.
Noam Lovinsky :
Oh wow.
Lenny :
I know Odessa.
Noam Lovinsky :
Oh, nice.
Lenny :
I don't want to talk about that much, but it's true. And I just realized we both have skys in our last name. Lovinsky and Rachitsky.
Noam Lovinsky :
So for what it's worth, my dad was born in Ukraine. He is from Kiev. My mom was from Lithuania, so yeah, I also have some Ukrainian background here.
Lenny :
All right, so Ukrainian episode.
Noam Lovinsky :
Yes.
Lenny :
Let me zoom out a little bit and get to the final couple questions. So thinking about your career broadly, I'm just curious if there's any general advice you share with people to help them have a more successful career. Anything that just generally you find is really important to do well or mistakes they make. And this is a big broad question, but anything come to mind of like, "Here's something you should really try to do more of or less of?"
Noam Lovinsky :
Look, when you're thinking about career opportunities and what job to take, it's really, really hard to sniff out really well in a high degree of certainty like success. I think that having a good nose for people and the sort of people that you can be successful with is something that you can develop. What I found is I always try to prioritize putting myself in positions that are going to cause a lot of growth and learning. And growth and learning can be very painful. And you kind of got to be okay with that and go into that because on the other side of that pain I think is the promised land.
:
And that's just served me really well, is I can't necessarily predict with high degree of certainty that this thing's going to hit, but I can get a sense of the people around me and I certainly can find situations that are going to stretch me, that are going to force me to do things that I haven't done where I'm going to grow and learn significantly. And over sort of the arc of my career, I feel like that's served me well. So that's usually what I tell people, is focus on on that if you can.
Lenny :
I love that advice. I've used this quote a number of times on this podcast, but something I always come back to is this line, "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek." I'm curious if there's something you have found about when the pain is too much, that you shouldn't pursue that. A lot of people get into these places where their mental health gets hit, their physical health is hit, they're just doing work they should not, it's too much. Is there anything there that you find it's just like, "Okay, maybe this is too much of discomfort"?
Noam Lovinsky :
I mean, I think about a couple of things. I think in any situation you should be able to lean on one or two things that you're really strong at. That can be the foundation that keeps you going while you learn the other things. So just be wary of situations that are too net new.
:
There should be one or two important things as part of that job going into where you're like, "I got this. I know how to do this portion of it." So as an example, if you've never inherited a very large team and you work through how that works, but the product area that you're working on is one you're very familiar with what's necessary to be good in that product, whether it's really good sense of design or really good sense of analytical thinking, recommendation systems, what have you, there should be a couple of those things where you're like, "I got this. These things are going to be a stretch, but these things, I feel like I've got a handle on how to do this. I can always get better, but I feel like they're in my wheelhouse." And I think that tends to allow you to balance the pain with the areas that you already know and manage through in a more balanced and healthy way.
Lenny :
It reminds me of that chart I think from flow of you want it to be challenging but not too challenging, and that's where you end up being most successful. Is there anything else, Noam, you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Noam Lovinsky :
Yeah, I just think that maybe going back to where we first started, Lenny, work on the things that make you happy, that fill you up. Life is short. We're all very lucky to be in this moment. There's no reason to spend time on things that don't give you energy. There's so much to do out there. I think that's the main thing I would focus on.
Lenny :

**Amazing. And even though there will be things that you have to do, I think it's important to try to find as much of that as you can because not everyone can just like, "Nah, I'm not going to do this work thing. I'm just going to go on a walk." But I think that's such an important point. And we've talked about this actually a bunch on recent podcasts of just doing this energy audit where you pay attention to what gives you energy and what doesn't and try to do more and more [inaudible 01**:

03:54]-
Noam Lovinsky :
Totally.
Lenny :
... willing to do that again. With that, we reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Noam Lovinsky :
Yeah, I'm ready.
Lenny :
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Noam Lovinsky :
I'm going to cheat on this one and I'm only going to give you one. I'm only going to give you one because I don't want to cloud with any other. I recommend Build by Tony Fidel. Other than it being a good book, one of the main reasons I recommend it is that my wife wrote it. So she wrote it together with Tony. And I got to see that experience. She's a fantastic writer and Tony has a lot to learn from, so I recommend that book. I think that the part of it that was particularly inspiring to me to hear even more of the details that are in the book is just how many times he met failure before he made discoveries that are now driving so many of the things that we do. It's just a good reminder to keep at it and do the thing that really gives you that energy because eventually you can make that incredible discovery.
Lenny :
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Noam Lovinsky :
I really like For All Mankind, if you've seen that on Apple TV. And then I just finished the last season of Fargo. Every single season of that series I think is fantastic.
Lenny :
Amazing. For All Mankind though, last season, not as amazing a consensus that I agree with, but worth watching.
:
Next question. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?
Noam Lovinsky :
I generally like interview questions that allow us to kind of do some work together, so I'm a little bit less on the behavioral "tell me about a time when" sort of stuff and more on the "Let's work a product problem together." It could be anything from like, "Let's design an alarm clock for children." Or lately I've been using one. "Given where technology is at, if we were to rebuild email, how might we do that?" I just feel like getting into it and getting into the details and really watching each other exercise our craft I think is really important. I have a whole podcast one time, if you're ready, about how most people don't know how to do leadership recruiting. And I feel like as I've advanced in my career, the interviews for some reason get easier and actually I can evaluate less about who I am as a product leader and whatnot. But yeah, those are the sorts of interview questions that I typically like.
Lenny :
Amazing. Is there favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?
Noam Lovinsky :
It's not recent, but I was a very early user of Arc and I really love Arc.
Lenny :
Your window right now is inside Arc. I also love Arc. We had Josh on the podcast.
Noam Lovinsky :
Nice.
Lenny :
Just watching the onboarding experience of Arc alone as a product person is worth your time.
Noam Lovinsky :
Totally. I love the animation when you download something. I mean just like all of the little things. And if Josh is listening, we would like to get Grammarly to work better with Arc, so please hit me up because I think there's a few things that the Arc browser is doing that make it hard to get Grammarly to work either on the client or in the browser.
Lenny :
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends or family either in work or in life that you find useful?
Noam Lovinsky :
Gosh, for those that know me, this is going to share so much of my personality. I think the first thing that comes to mind is, we are meant to struggle. I just feel like through struggle is how we get better, how good things happen, how bonds form, and so I don't shy away from that kind of life experience.
Lenny :
I'm going to guess that you're Jewish. I'm also Jewish. That feels like a very Jewish thing to say. I love it.
Noam Lovinsky :
How would you guess, Lenny? It's literally written on my face. Yeah.
Lenny :
Perfect. Last question. As the chief product officer at Grammarly, I'm curious what word you most often misspell?
Noam Lovinsky :
The.
Lenny :
You do T-E-H?
Noam Lovinsky :
T-E-H. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Lenny :
Oh, man. Well, I find I misspell every word.
Noam Lovinsky :
Oh, that's funny.
Lenny :
I'm a terrible speller. I'm thankful for my... Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
Noam Lovinsky :
I was about to say I have a product for you that can help with your spelling if you want.
Lenny :
I am an active Grammarly user. Not only that. I use every product you've worked on, I realize.
Noam Lovinsky :
Oh, nice.
Lenny :
Obviously, Meta and mostly Instagram of the Meta products. And obviously Grammarly now and YouTube. I have a YouTube channel. Check it out. Subscribe and follow. And Thumbtack. My wife is a big Thumbtack user. We found many pros on Thumbtack from all kinds of parts of the world.
:
Noam, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?
Noam Lovinsky :
Yeah. I'm pretty much @noaml everywhere online, so Twitter is probably the easiest. My DMs are open. And then how people can be useful to me is please use Grammarly, provide any feedback that you might have. And honestly, if I can be helpful in almost any way, feel free to reach out. I often will take those conversations and build those connections, and that is always very helpful for me as well.
Lenny :
No, thank you again so much for being here.
Noam Lovinsky :
Of course. Have a good one, Lenny.
Lenny :
Bye everyone.
Noam Lovinsky :
Bye.
