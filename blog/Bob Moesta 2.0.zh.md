**Amazon is where you... Amazon borders, all the big book retailers you can find it. It's called Job Moves**:

9 Steps for Making Progress in Your Career Yep. There we go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I got one here too.
Bob Moesta :
And to be honest, my thing is you can also go to jobmoves.com and it has basically free resources to basically help you walk through the process, steps themselves. And so if you go to jobmoves.com, it'll, there's a test to tell you what Quest you're in. There's a form for doing the interviews. There's a form basically to help you with prototyping, et cetera.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Actually have Jobmoves.com, I was checking the book to make sure you had the right domain. That's a great domain.
Bob Moesta :
We did, we did. We worked hard. Well, to be honest, it was one of the reasons why we named the book the way it was because the domain was available.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think you had read, you were originally going to call this book, Hire Your Next Job or something like that.
Bob Moesta :
Yeah, yeah. Actually, if you go into my Dropbox and you look at it's called My Next Thing. It was really about helping people find their next thing. But in the end, the publisher had to have influence on it, of course. And so I think I'm happy with Job Moves. I think it's a good thing. What's interesting is we can't... Hiring your next job was very inside job Jobs-to-be-Done pun kind of thing. But the reality is you had to be inside Jobs-to-be-Done, to get the pun, so it didn't really make sense to other people outside it. So it is what is.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Go for that big tam.
Bob Moesta :
Yeah, I guess that's exactly right.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bob, this is incredible. Thank you so much for being here.
Bob Moesta :
Thank you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think it's going to be helpful to a lot of people, so thank you.
Bob Moesta :
Thank you, Lenny. Thank you so much for your time. And if they want to reach out to me, please, LinkedIn is the best place to go. And what I would say is one favor I could ask your listeners is that I'm a very curious person and I love to solve struggling moments, and so I might regret saying this, but the reality is if you have a struggling moment that you've been struggling with for a long time and you have no solution to help you figure it out, drop me a line so I can actually start to accumulate some of these struggling moments to figure out where I should go next.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's a very generous offer. What's the best way to reach out? You said on LinkedIn?
Bob Moesta :
LinkedIn, and just LinkedIn messaging. I'll accept the invite, or you can do it in message. It doesn't matter. But LinkedIn is the best way. I get too many emails and I have a very specific process around how I manage LinkedIn. That's just very useful for me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, awesome. I'm glad you answered the question I forgot to ask, which is how listeners can be useful to you. So thank you for doing that.
Bob Moesta :
Yeah, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bob, thank you so much.
Bob Moesta :
Thanks, Lenny.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bye, everyone.
