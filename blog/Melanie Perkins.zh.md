## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### Amazing. Something I'm going to just let people know, I don't know if people know all this, how many products you all have now. I think a lot of people think of Canva as a design graphics for social media and marketing and things like that, but you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, code, AI coding tool. And now what I'm hearing is email forums. There's probably a few other things I'm not thinking [inaudible 00

47:36]-
Melanie Perkins :
Yeah, truly design anything. We're literally living up to that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh my god, it's happening.
Melanie Perkins :
100 million people design a presentation in Canva each month now and it's pretty fascinating to see that when you speak to, I saw a tweet some time ago. They were talking about how it's a generational thing that a certain generation uses Microsoft, a certain generation uses Google. Gen Z, the way they design a presentation is in Canva, but it's ...

### I'm going to keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. So here's the question

what's a way you've found in your personal life and work life to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might find useful?
Melanie Perkins :
So many things. So AI is often the first. If I'm having an idea, it'll be a first place that I go and explore the idea. And now with Canva, and you can just tag Canva, I can say, "Give me more ideas of this," and it's shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design. It's actually integrated ...

### Wow. There's so much power to that one thought nugget there is just, there's all these tools now that can make building so much easier. You can just build anything you want, just describe it. But so many people are just like, I'm in the same boat. I'm just stuck. "What do I want?" I don't even don't know what I need. What should I build? And that's exactly what you're talking about there. Okay. Last question. So I saw it somewhere that you were an aspiring figure skater in your early years in high school, you had to wake up at 4

30 A.M. to practice. Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building Canva?
Melanie Perkins :
So many things are quite directly applicable, falling down over and over again and getting up and trying again, the importance of hard work and determination. I think the falling down, it was quite literal in my figure skating in days, and maybe it was a little more metaphorical in today, but it is constant.

Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh my god, it's happening.
Melanie Perkins :
100 million people design a presentation in Canva each month now and it's pretty fascinating to see that when you speak to, I saw a tweet some time ago. They were talking about how it's a generational thing that a certain generation uses Microsoft, a certain generation uses Google. Gen Z, the way they design a presentation is in Canva, but it's not just generational for those with other generational ilk, but it is been fascinating to see that come to life.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The email product, is that like a email client product or It's a design emails that you can then send through your products?
Melanie Perkins :
It is design emails, so you can design email, then you can take that code and you can pop it into any email platform that you use.
Lenny Rachitsky :
How do you think about products you're going to expand to, I know there's trade secrets here. You don't want to tell everyone where you're going next, but just how do you approach, here's where we're going next.
Melanie Perkins :
So our mission, empower world design, empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and just take those things very literally. So to literally design anything, to literally publish anywhere. And so we now print in 50 something countries around the world and you can get it printed and delivered to your house. And we plant it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I actually did that, while you're on it.
Melanie Perkins :
Oh, awesome.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I wasn't planning this, but I had a print thing delivered to my house. It's so cool.
Melanie Perkins :
Oh, yeah. Exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
We have to go to a print shop in this freaking graphic and well here's a button. Let's click that.
Melanie Perkins :
Exactly. Just click print and it pops up beautifully packaged to your door.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I don't know how that works. Yeah, I don't know how you did that, but it worked. How cool.
Melanie Perkins :
But it's very cool. And so yeah, I guess literally bring these things to life. Oh, we're like launching 3D as well. So all of these things we will be bringing to life literally. And just picking off what is the most strategically important next thing to enable everyone to design anything, to enable everyone to publish anywhere. And we have been doing that for a decade and we'll continue to do that forever more using the latest technology to truly bring people's ideas to life.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, so this is helpful. So if someone's like, "Oh, will Canva come for my space?" Are people designing thing that was design and also, what was it? Publish?
Melanie Perkins :
Publishing anywhere.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. Publishing and designing. Okay. So if you're doing any designing or publishing, watch out.
Melanie Perkins :
From a macro perspective, there was creativity tools and productivity tools. And what Canva really does is we're literally smack bang in the middle of that Venn diagram of creativity and productivity, rather than making our customers have to make a choice between those two suites.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Something I wasn't planning on asking about, but I think it's on everyone's minds. There's always this Figma and Adobe and then there's Canva and there's kind of a bunch of places we could go with this. One is just at the beginning of the journey where a lot of founders try to figure out their wedge and their specific niche. Just how did you think about that? "Here's how we might have a chance to..." I know Figma wasn't even around back then, I don't think. Just how did you approach your early wedge of users?
Melanie Perkins :
One of the most important things that we did was we didn't really worry about competitors at all. We actually just saw where is there a gap in the market that we can uniquely fill, and what can we solve a problem, a core problem that people currently have today? And so with our first company that was yearbooks in Australia and there wasn't great tools and these yearbook coordinators got thrown in to have to design something and they'd have no design experience. And we spoke to every single customer. We gave them an over the phone tutorial, we understood all of their pain points, we got continuous customer feedback, and then we tried to iterate and improve.
:
And then when we were thinking about Canva, a few years into that, actually one of the schools said, "I love this product so much. Can I use it to design newsletters?" And they had all sorts of other things that they wanted to use it for, and we kind of looked around and were like, "Oh, there's still nothing on the market." This was a few years into it, that actually does the thing that we're doing, but for all these other things. And so it was much more like where is the gap in the market that people are currently having a pain point? And if you can solve that pain point really well and solve it in such a way that people actually want to pay for it because it is truly solving a real pain point that they have, I think that kind of sets it up for success rather than be a problem or a solution looking for a problem.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So what I'm hearing there is you didn't overthink, "Here's my CP, here's the wedge and the strategy of how we expand into this large thing." It's like, "Here's people with a problem that hasn't been solved in years that we keep seeing. Let's try to solve it."
Melanie Perkins :
Exactly that. And if you take that problem centered approach that helps people to achieve something they actually want to do in the real life, you're probably going to be at a reasonably good spot, especially if it maps to a larger market. That's a particularly great thing. If it only solves one person's problem, that might not be a great company going forward. But if a few people have that same problem... But I think that again, back to that big ladder and that first rung, I think it's better to solve a small number of people's problem really well than trying to solve a large number of people's problem. Not very well at all.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Something I can't not ask about is just how you think about AI in your product. You mentioned how you integrated or all through the product, just you guys are doing really good stuff with AI. A lot of companies are struggling to find something really that works great. Do you have just a philosophy of, "Here's how we integrate AI into Canva," where it ends up being really helpful and people love it?
Melanie Perkins :
Your question is actually the answer at the same time. I think being able to integrate it into the product where it actually helps people to get their work done where it genuinely helps them to achieve their goals, and then being really open to listening to your community and hearing what they're loving, what they're struggling with and refining from there I think is really, really important. Just because AI is all the rage and investors really like AI doesn't necessarily mean it should be front and center, but if it can genuinely help your customers to achieve their goals. So the thing that I was mentioning before, enabling people to communicate their ideas and have little friction between those two points, AI is just kind of naturally a very critical part of that equation for us. In fact, it was funny looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing because it really was critical to what we were trying to do even in our 2012 deck. You can kind of imagine how AI very much fit into the equation because of exactly what we're trying to do.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**I'm going to keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. So here's the question**:

what's a way you've found in your personal life and work life to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might find useful?
Melanie Perkins :
So many things. So AI is often the first. If I'm having an idea, it'll be a first place that I go and explore the idea. And now with Canva, and you can just tag Canva, I can say, "Give me more ideas of this," and it's shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design. It's actually integrated deeply into your workflow. Another really fun thing I do is an AI walk and it's when I just put my ear pods in and then I go for a walk and I just say everything on my mind and I use that to then kind of filter out my thoughts and figure out what are the things I need to action. And it kind of helps again, get out of the weeds and think about things from a more macro perspective rather than from the things that might be in my Slack messages or in my email. It just gives you that sort of helpful vantage point I find. So yeah, so many things.
Lenny Rachitsky :
For the Voice Note tool, is there a tool that you find useful for that?
Melanie Perkins :
Yeah, I might use Apple Notes or directly into Canva Docs, and then I actually just do the brain dump into Canva Docs and then just summarize them.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Got it. And so you just use native microphone-
Melanie Perkins :
Exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
... dictation sort of thing. Nothing fancy?
Melanie Perkins :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay.
Melanie Perkins :
Yeah, I like it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This reminded me of, you mentioned earlier in our conversation you had this vision board that you said is for 2050. Is that right?
Melanie Perkins :
Yeah, that's right.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Can you share something from that vision board?
Melanie Perkins :
I'll tell you why the vision board came about because it's only been in recent months. I did feel like as humanity, we are on a bit of a freight train and that freight training is, I think if we take a lot of visions for a lot of different companies and a lot of things that are happening and you just fast-forward 50 years or you do 2050 and you say, "Are we in a safer world? Is the world the place that we want our kids to grow up in? Is this the humanity that we want?" I didn't feel that the train that we are headed on always feels great. In fact, it scared me quite greatly for a whole host of reasons. And so I sat with that feeling for a little and then I kind of got to work on my 2050 walls and back to the chaos to clarity.
:
The first thing was riding my 2050 wall and I've really been loving, I've got a whole on the 2050 wall, started with a lot of quotes. Everything good was once imagined and many other quotes were along those similar lines. And then rather than just being fearful of the things that I'm worried about for society and for humanity, I started to think what would the alternative be? What is that vision that I would love to see us have basic human needs for all global education being a basic human right that everyone experiences all the really important things that we want as humanity. And again, using vision and using imagination and just dreaming about the future. And I find it really fascinating in my day-to-day by literally having it beside me as I work every day, the little tiny decisions that can kind of help to angle towards that future that we want and can I help will any of that into existence? I honestly don't know.
:
But I feel like just by starting to write it down some little brainstorm exercise with a number of other people and starting to just etch out, how do we get closer and closer to that. On my vision of the future, it's community. It's the whole of humanity trying to dream bigger and to dream bigger goals. And then us actually rising to that occasion in the world. We don't want, I think loneliness is rife, purpose is gone. What we teach people in schools is pointless. And in my vision for 2050, it's none of those things. Communities are bound to fall. We all have deep purpose. And that deep purpose springs from having bigger dreams that we collectively go out and achieve. Something that we're doing at our Canva world to a keynote in two weeks time, which I think is going to be after this is released, we've been asking people what is one goal you'd like to see the world achieved in our lifetime?
:
And then people literally writing it down I think is pretty powerful. And then people sharing that with other people I think is pretty powerful. And then us actually figuring out how the hell do we turn? That reality that we all deeply desperately want into existence, I think is genuinely one of the biggest questions of our time. But then again, rather than trying to tackle that entire thing by yourself, how do you take that first tiny step that starts to see that in your own life, in your own family, in your own community? And I think that's where we'll get purpose from and I think that is one of the key answers to loneliness is actually working towards something bigger than yourself.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. I really appreciate you sharing all that. I was thinking as you're talking, just considering how wildly successful Canva has been and just how ambitious that was when you started. I would not be at all surprised that this actually happens and that you achieve this very difficult vision.
Melanie Perkins :
It's not something that I alone can achieve. I think it has to be obviously a global collective effort because there's zero chance I can go and achieve basic human needs for all. But I think that I'd like to change that. I'd like to help change the mood. I'd like to help change the way we're thinking about things. I genuinely think we need to move course a little and decide not what are all the things that we... what's the freight train we're currently on, but what is it that we actually want? What do we want our societies to look like? What do we want the world to look like? Is it good enough that there's people, hundreds of millions of people that can't eat? What the hell? It just literally makes no sense.
Lenny Rachitsky :
A column B world, you might say.
Melanie Perkins :
Absolutely.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Melanie, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?
Melanie Perkins :
You have been extremely extensive. I don't think I've got anything else to add, frankly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's the goal. That's the goal. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Melanie, are you ready?
Melanie Perkins :
Let's go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
Melanie Perkins :
One of the books I love is The Power of Moments, and it talks, am I supposed to be really fast and not tell you about it?
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's all good.
Melanie Perkins :
Okay. Two books, the Power of Moments, and one of the books early on I read was Designing the Obvious, which I found very insightful.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I like they shifted to fast mode. You don't have to go superfast. All good. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Not Canva.
Melanie Perkins :
I love the Calm app. It is my daily companion. I use it to meditate. I use it to listen to music. I just find it very calming.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. First question. I usually ask about movies and TV shows. I hear you don't watch a lot because you're so busy and have so much going on. So I'm going to try it, new question I haven't asked before. I'm curious where this goes. So excluding Canva, what's a product you'd love to work on someday, whether it's like an existing other company like, "Oh, I wish I could work on that thing," or just a new product you'd love to build maybe after the Canva chapter.
Melanie Perkins :
I feel like my Canva chapter's going to go on for a long time, so I don't know, because we've got-
Lenny Rachitsky :
On the side, on the side.
Melanie Perkins :
... decent plans side and we're pretty extensive.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, maybe a company you'd love to fund. There we go.
Melanie Perkins :
I feel like there's a lot of opportunity to create global infrastructure that is truly empowering. And so as I look at my 2050 wall, I think there's a lot of things that are currently only exclusively available to a small number of people that should be available to everyone. And so the more that we can do to uplift the rising tide lifts all boats I think is a thing that's just so of such critical importance. And I think there is this weird belief that you can be fine and everyone else can be not fine and that's all cool. I don't think that's cool. I think everyone suffers in such a case. So I think more things that help everyone to rise.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Maybe along those lines, but maybe not, is there a life motto that you find yourself coming back to and work your own life?
Melanie Perkins :
There's a few. I love the quote, happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. I feel like that's a constant aspiration. And then I've just been so obsessed lately with the idea that everything is led by imagination. That imagination is the very first step of that creative process. So everything is good because once imagined is a quote you're going to be seeing from Canva all the time now because it is true that if you don't imagine it, you can't will it into existence. And in fact, everything great that we experience in life was first imagined.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**Wow. There's so much power to that one thought nugget there is just, there's all these tools now that can make building so much easier. You can just build anything you want, just describe it. But so many people are just like, I'm in the same boat. I'm just stuck. "What do I want?" I don't even don't know what I need. What should I build? And that's exactly what you're talking about there. Okay. Last question. So I saw it somewhere that you were an aspiring figure skater in your early years in high school, you had to wake up at 4**:

30 A.M. to practice. Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building Canva?
Melanie Perkins :
So many things are quite directly applicable, falling down over and over again and getting up and trying again, the importance of hard work and determination. I think the falling down, it was quite literal in my figure skating in days, and maybe it was a little more metaphorical in today, but it is constant.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**You're right. I wonder what that metaphor is for figure skating. I don't know. Anyway, Melanie, this was incredible. I am so thankful that you agreed to do this. Two final questions**:

where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out, send you feedback on Canvas or join Canva, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Melanie Perkins :
Really great questions. So you can find me on LinkedIn. That's where I post the most. And you can go to and I can get the URL to give us your wishes and we want to hear them and we literally listen to them. It doesn't just go into a suggestion box. And then how can they be helpful? Use Canva, spread Canva, teach Canva. We're doing a Canva World Tour through October, which is probably going to be updated when this is posted.
:
Come to our events. We do events all around the world and we'd love to see you and to hear from you. And if you are in a company, starting a company, try and do the 1% pledge. Try and figure out your own version of the two-step plan and try and build products and in every decision that you make that actually makes the world that you want to live in. I think there's this kind of belief sometimes that the world is created by other people, but we all have a very active hand in creating the world that we live in. And every decision that you make for investors, every company that you fund, is that contributing the world to the world that you want to live in? Or is it creating the freight train that none of us want to be on?
Lenny Rachitsky :
I have to ask before I let you go. Are you going to have the rap dancers at the next Canva event?
Melanie Perkins :
You'll have to wait and see.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. Melanie, thank you so much for being here.
Melanie Perkins :
Thank you so much, Lenny, for having me and your great well-researched questions.
Lenny Rachitsky :
