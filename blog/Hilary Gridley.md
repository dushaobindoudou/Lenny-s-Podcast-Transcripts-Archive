If it's somebody who knows what all those things are, and you're just there to kind of help them carve out time, that's one thing. But I think, and a lot of times, people don't even know.

03:50] tools, to get their work done, in just a generic and get work done way. And so, I have this little tool, if you sign up for my newsletter, I'll send it to you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What's the URL of the newsletter, as you mention that?
Hilary Gridley :
Thanks for asking. It is hils.substack.com, H-I-L-S, substack.com.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Sweet.
Hilary Gridley :
But basically, it's one little thing you can do every single day. And the key with this is, again, consistency. So you need to get people doing this thing every day, reducing friction. I think a mistake a lot of people make when they start thinking about how to drive adoption is, they're like, "Oh, we have to show people how to do their work with these tools."
:
But I'm like, "Well, work is hard." And if you are on a deadline for something, you've got to get something done, the last thing that you ever want is more friction associated with getting it done. It is so annoying when you're trying to get a thing done, and your tools are being changed on you, and you don't know how the thing works, and the hot keys are all different, or whatever.
:
So I actually think, using it in situations that have nothing to do with your work are way easier, because you're removing all of that friction of, "Oh wait, I got to go think about, 'All right, what's a project that I'm working on? Oh, I put this into ChatGPT, and I didn't really get a good answer.'"
:
Or, "Now I'm frustrated, because this thing's taking longer than I need it to take, or whatever." I start with things that are just fun, simple use cases. It might be coming up with times to take a vacation, or places to go on vacation.
:
Or it might be uploading your calendar into ChatGPT, and asking it for ideas, for talking points for the meetings, or things where the person doesn't have to think, because it's all just spelled out.
:
And things where there's no external work pressure, that you have to apply this to, that's going to make it an unpleasant experience. So consistency, reduce friction. And then, most importantly, designing reward loops.
:
And this is something, that when I'm talking to people about designing for behavior change, the number one thing I always tell them is, "You are not thinking enough about the reward loop." The reward loop needs to be powerful, it needs to be immediate, and it needs to be emotional, so that when this person does the thing that you want them to do, they feel like a million bucks.
:
When I think about any kind of habit I'm trying to build on my team, that's something that I'm always thinking about, is how can I make sure that when a person does this, they feel really great?
:
And part of why I like Custom GPTs as a tool for helping people learn to use LLMs, and I talk about this on the podcast I did with Claire, on how I AI, is because if you put in the prompt, you as the person building the custom GPT, you write the prompt, you put it in, you design it such that somebody can upload a specific document. And then, they can get a specific output, like feedback on that document, or maybe something more fun than feedback, an improved written version of that document.
:
They get the joy of like, "Oh, this helps me. This was cool," without any of the despair of, "Oh, I'm not very good at prompting, and this didn't really work, and I'm frustrated." And so, I just always think about that in general. If I'm trying to build any kind of habit on my team, it's less about the accountability of how I'm enforcing this, and more about how I make it so rewarding for people to do it, that they do it naturally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I wrote down notes as you were talking, so kind of, the four parts of habits, and I'm going to ask you for an example, to help people see how this actually works in real life. But basically, to help people build an actual habit, the three steps are the three things you want to focus on, consistency, friction, and reward loop. And within reward loop, you want it to be powerful, immediate, and emotional. What is an example of this?
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, I can give some, actually, examples of how we do this in product, if that would be interesting.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Absolutely.
Hilary Gridley :
Because I think there's something WHOOP is really good at. So I think one of the most interesting kind of anti-reward loops on WHOOP is around alcohol. WHOOP has this recovery system. You get a recovery score every morning. It's red, yellow, green, and it's basically how recovered you are, and how ready you are to take on the day.
:
And if you drink, and you're on WHOOP, you will very quickly learn that any time you drink, you get a red recovery. It's so interesting, because it's not like people who were drinking weren't getting hangovers before, or they knew that it was disrupting their sleep. None of this is news for people, but there's something about seeing that red score that just feels like, it just feels bad. It has this really profound emotional impact on people.
:
And when you see the green score, it feels great. It's like, "Ooh, I'm doing something well, I'm taking care of myself. I'm a healthy person." And I hear this when I talk to members all the time, and I hear people say, "I've had problems with my drinking for years. And it wasn't until I got on WHOOP, that I was really able to get a handle on my drinking."
:
I'm always, again, amazed by this, because I'm like, "You had all the information you needed before," but there's something about the, you wake up, and you get that red score, that's just, it manages to override whatever was driving people to do it in the first place.
:
And then, I think, continuing to have that data, where you can look back at your data and see, "Oh, that was the red day, that was the day that I did this thing." And it's something that we've actually been trying to find ways to do this in a longer term way.
:
Because when you have these short reward loops, it's easier, where it's like, "I did a thing." And then, I immediately either got a reward, Green Recovery, or got an anti-reward, Red Recovery, and that is changing my behavior as a result.
:
And we have this new feature, Healthspan, that we just launched with our new hardware. And basically, what it's trying to do is help you have this reward loop, between your behaviors and activities that you're doing today, and what means for how healthy you're going to be in 20, 30, 40 years.
:
And so, we have something similar where we have this, we call it the Amoeba. It has your WHOOP age in it. It has colors, and moves around, and that changes, based on how your behaviors and your activities change, every single day.
:
And the colors change when you're doing better, and when you're doing worse. And you can kind of see it all broken down, how you sleep, your VO2 Max, the consistency of your sleep, how much time you're spending in different heart rate zones, how much time you're spending in strength training, things like that.
:
And we found that, again, it's just this incredibly powerful reward loop, because we're taking something that historically has been really, really hard, which is, "When I make healthy changes today, not only do I not see the results of those for decades, but the short term reward loop of those often feels pretty bad, because change is hard, and it feels bad before it feels good."
:
And trying to build that reward loop that is more rewarding for people to see those numbers change, and to see those colors change, so that they're actually able to make those changes, and see that progress, and feel really good about it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that you're using all these habit building tactics that folks have been using historically, to get you to check your Instagram likes, and your Facebook posts for actual good, for helping people live longer and happier. That makes me very happy.
:
Is there an example of doing this sort of thing with your team, of helping them build, and you talk about AI learning to use Claude, ChatGPT?
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, I think with AI, I think a lot of it's just shouting people out, right? When somebody is using AI to solve a problem that they wouldn't have used AI before, give them a shout-out in the team meeting, let them demo that.
:
Again, make them feel like a million bucks for doing the thing. And people respond to that, people will see, I mean, maybe it's because I work at WHOOP, and we're all obsessed with reward loops, so we're all choosing them.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Or reward looping each other. "Here's your reward."
Hilary Gridley :
No, exactly. But no, people see that, and people respond to it. I think another example is something that I think about a lot, and is relevant to our conversation about, just how you build teams that can do hard things, is how you encourage people to take care of themselves outside of work. And it's something that I'm always trying to model for my team, and make it really visible the ways that I'm doing this, and sort of having my hobbies, and my other various things.
:
And as a result, I also try to reward, have these reward loops, when I see people on my team doing the same thing. Because I think people, bosses often inadvertently create reward loops for, "Oh, this person, they had to stay up till two o'clock to get it done, but they got it done." When you create those reward loops, that's the behavior that people start mimicking.
:
And so, I try to do the opposite. I try to find ways that I really am impressed with my team, and the ways that they take care of themselves outside of work, because I think that makes them better at their jobs, frankly, and just happier humans. So there's a PM on my team, Emily, who teaches at Handlebar. She's a fitness instructor in her spare time.
:
And so, whenever we have a long meeting, I'll be like, "Oh, Emily, why don't you lead stretches, to get the energy level in the room up? Just nothing serious, just for a minute, before we start the meeting." And it's kind of fun. Everyone has a laugh about it, "Emily's doing her thing," and I'll be like, "Everyone, come check out Emily at Handlebar in Charlestown this Saturday, 10 a.m."
:
And by the way, you all out there in the podcast world should do that if you're in the Boston area, she's great. Shout-out to Emily. But it's things like that. It's just finding these small ways to, because people are already laughing, people are already smiling, we're doing this silly thing, everyone's in a good mood, and I'm like, "Boom, perfect time to give someone a shout-out, and make them feel like a million bucks for doing something, that in many cases, they might think, 'Oh, am I allowed to have this other job outside work? Is this okay?'" And so yeah, you got to proactively build those reward loops.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love the reward loop of Emily getting this shout-out right now. This is so meta.
Hilary Gridley :
Ultimate reward.
Lenny Rachitsky :
You have a full class coming up in Boston. Is there anything else along those lines? Because that was really interesting? And also, people, I know managers already kind of do this, just promoting.
:
But so, I think the core lesson here is, focus on things you want to encourage more. Less so, "Hey, they worked the weekend, they got it done, so awesome. Thank you for doing that."
:
You're saying that's almost an anti-pattern, because you don't necessarily want that as a habit. So it's more like, shift your reward announcements to things you actually, intentionally want to create, in a new team.
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, and just be really, really thoughtful about it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, okay. So let's come back to the taking care of yourself, because that's something else that came up, almost everyone mentioned this. So you're doing a good job with this, of finding time to take care of yourself, and modeling that for other people.
:
Specifically, a lot of people commented on how you create space for creativity. And I think, to a lot of people, a lot of PMs, especially, is just, "I have no time for anything. I just have meetings, back to back, all day. I barely have time to go to the bathroom or eat."
:
And I'm curious to hear just how you do this. How do you create space in your day for creative work, and deep work, and thinking outside of the meeting?
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, it's funny. I'm glad to hear people think I'm good at this, because I'm terrible at organizing events. My team's always, "Oh, we should do a fun event." I'm like, "Yeah, that's a great idea."
:
And then I don't organize it. So I like to think, I do this in other ways. And I do think one of them is just in modeling, how to carve out space for things, and a couple of things. I think there's the creativity, which for me is probably more outside of work. For me, it's creativity.
:
But again, it's a big part of me as a manager, what I think I can help people with is, back to the point of behavioral activation, understanding what the things are that a person needs to be happy, to be their best self, to be a high functioning person. That depends on their values, it depends on a lot of things about them. So for Emily, it's fitness, it's teaching, it's these things. For me, it's having my crafts that I do, my illustration, my writing, my reading, all of these sorts of things.
:
I think that that's the first step is just, as a leader, understanding what those are for people on your team. And then, as I said, modeling it.
:
I try to always tell people, "Here's how I'm doing these things." I talk about them, so it's really normalized, because I think a lot of PMs are like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so busy. I have no time. I'm in meetings all day." But that's a little bit self-inflicted, I think.
:
At some point, you have to be the one responsible for getting yourself out of the weeds, and it's hard to do, but it is doable. So I think, just showing people that it's possible, showing people that you can do these things. And I talk about them, I bring them to lessons.
:
I have a book club that I sometimes require at work, and then I say, "Maybe I don't need to require this anymore," but ways to just make it really visible, make sure people know that I'm doing it, and then ask them about it.
:
If I, in my one on one lens, and I'm checking in with people, I'm asking them, "What do you do for joy? Are you doing something every single day that's bringing you joy in your life?" And if they say no, I'm like, "That's a problem. What are we going to do about that? And do you even know what those things are?"
:

**Because I think a lot of people don't, and a lot of people, it's great. They're like, "Oh, I need to be getting X number of hours of exercise, X hours of sleep. I know I need to eat lunch right at 12**:

00, or else I turn into a pumpkin."
:
If it's somebody who knows what all those things are, and you're just there to kind of help them carve out time, that's one thing. But I think, and a lot of times, people don't even know. Then you kind of behavioral activation them, where you're like, "All right, well, why don't you try some things, and get back to me, and let me know what seemed to work, what seemed to make a difference?"
:
But I do think so much of it is like a permission structure, because people feel the pressure to be like, "Oh, I'm so busy, I'm so busy, I'm in meetings all day.
:
I can't decline these meetings. I can't not do these things." So in many ways, I think just modeling, it gives them the permission structure to start to take back their life.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I could see why people love working for you. Being asked in your one on one, "Have you done anything today that brings you joy? And if you haven't, that's a problem." Wow.
Hilary Gridley :
It's important. It's what life's all out. Why are we here, if it's just to toil, and be miserable?
Lenny Rachitsky :
And also, they will be better people at work, and they'll do better work. I think that's, tell me, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like that's an element of this.
Hilary Gridley :
Well, and it is so funny, because so much of this stuff, it's obvious when you apply it to an athletic context. And obviously, I talked about the recovery score. This concept of athletes need to recover is very obvious. No one, I think, would argue with that.
:
If you're just pushing yourself at 100% of your physical capacity all the time, not only are you going to burn out, but you're literally going to suffer performance decline. And in the same way, I think in the athletic world, there's so much more, just acceptance of, I don't even want to say limits, but just like, you have to take the time to do the things you need to be your best. And that's not just running into the wall all day.
:
And I think we forget that at work, but I think the analog is 100% there. I also think about this with, in terms of being able to have creative breakthroughs of any kind, it's just so important to have active rest. It's so important to have heads downtime. This stuff is all very well documented. We know it all, but we just come up with excuses to not give it to ourselves. I think it's kind of self-sabotage, at a certain point.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I definitely come up with excuses not to do that, and work all the time. So I could use this advice myself.
Hilary Gridley :
And that's why, here's the thing, here's the thing. The Reason I'm so regimented about this is because, if I'm not, I will fall apart. There's this quote, I can't remember where I saw this, but I love it. It's like, "I have exercised the demons from my head, but they are outside and they are doing pushups."
:
The threat of the demons coming back is always there. And so, I take this stuff really seriously, because I know, if I let myself start to slide into, I'm not doing the things I need to do to take care of myself, I'm going to have a bad time. The walls are going to start closing in around me.
:
And I'm not shy about that. To me, there's no point in torturing myself, and just working so hard, and having no room for joy, and having no room for creativity. Even just from a practical standpoint, I'm just not going to succeed.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This comes back to your point about, I think it was called behavioral activation, doing the thing. Instead of waiting for you to feel a certain feeling, do the thing that will make you feel that way.
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. As maybe a final area, but I have a few more questions after this, so maybe not. The final area is AI. I am happy that we waited this long to get deep into AI. We're not going to spend a lot of time here. You wrote a whole guest post about this. You did How I AI to talk through some of this stuff.
:
But when we were talking earlier, you said that you think people still are completely undervaluing the power AI could have on their ability to learn, and improve themselves. And I know you spent a lot of time on this, with all these GPTs you've built.
:
Just talk about the sense of how much you think people still under-appreciate how much power there is in AI, and helping them become better.
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah. I think we are not being nearly creative enough, when it comes to how to think about learning with AI. And I think, you hear people worry about entry level jobs, and when you think about an entry level job, it is sort of inefficient by design, because you have taken analyst, sort of a classic entry level role.
:
They're doing grunt work, they're doing really tedious work, but they're getting a lot of reps in, because that's exactly how you learn the judgment to do higher level jobs well. And I hear this in creative fields too. I hear this from every, I certainly feel this way.
:
The work that I did in the beginning of my career, it didn't feel like it was all that important, in terms of the impact it was having, but it did feel like it was transformative, in terms of my own judgment and my own taste, and how I think about just making very quick judgment calls.
:
Now, I just wouldn't have been able to do that, if I didn't spend years learning. I used to do social media, the skill of having to condense something that I want to say into 120 characters, or whatever it used to be on old Twitter, 240, I can't remember.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I forget, actually, isn't that crazy? I forget what the original was. I think it was 140. Okay, 140 characters, yeah.
Hilary Gridley :
140, I think. It was short. And if you had to get a link in there, good luck to you.
:
But oh my gosh, my ability to just look at something written today, and just cut it, that text in half, third, whatever it needs to fill the space, I can do that in my sleep, because I got all these reps very early in my career.
:
I think people see the way that there's a threat of companies not wanting to hire as much entry-level talent, because it's like, "Oh, this is the kind of work that AI can do."
:
The fear that I hear, at least, is if you're not getting those reps early in your career, maybe it's not contributing so much value to the company at that moment, but it's how you learn to be great later on.
:
And so, there's a fear that in five, 10 years, we're just not going to have that class of people, who have learned to do the jobs well, and who have built judgment in that way.
:
But what I think that misses is, it assumes that you go and you do this analyst job for two years, and at the end of it you have a person who knows how to make models really well, knows how to do a few things really well. But why does that have to take two years? Why does that model of you grind over this thing?
:
You wait for feedback. Eventually, you get that feedback. Maybe that feedback's good, maybe it's not. You go back, you try again. It actually is really inefficient, when you think about it.
:
And the sort of learning applicAttions around AI that I get really excited about are, how do you shrink that loop? So in my podcast with Claire, I showed her how I build these GPTs, that kind of think like me. And the purpose of that is so that my team can get feedback that is at least 80% close to the feedback that I would be giving them.
:
But instead of having to wait until I get to their message, or until our one on one, they can get that on demand as many times as they want forever. And I think there's a lot of things like this, of ways that things that require other people, just naturally slow things down, require getting feedback from other people, just naturally slow things down.
:
We can build AI tools that, in my view, there's no reason why the amount of reps that you get at whatever task you're doing, you can be a film editor, just sitting there, poring over the film, deciding what to edit, what to cut, what to put into the trailer, or whatever it's making. That's an incredibly tedious job that takes forever.
:
And I think there's no reason we can't make that way more efficient with AI, that make the learning more fun. And so, I think that that's sort of my hot take is yes, there is this threat of, a lot of these jobs that are things that seem like you can just automate them away, that might happen.
:
But we absolutely still need to be investing in people's skills. I just don't think we need to be investing in them historically in the way that we always have. And I think in the future, we'll find that those ways actually seem quite inefficient, compared to what's possible today.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's such a powerful point. And we're already seeing this. I imagine you've seen these studies, I think it's in Nigeria, where they give students AI tutors, and they just zoom to the next, they accelerate so quickly in their progression of just reading and math.
:
I think we're already seeing it. And it's harder to measure in PM and product, and all these things, but in school, it's a lot easier to measure, and we're already seeing results there.
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, 100%.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And to make this very real for people, you have this specific GPT, I think it's called Socrates, or what is called?
Hilary Gridley :
Oh, Aristotle, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Aristotle? Okay. No, we're going to edit that out. Aristotle, where it gives you scenarios in a product scenario.
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Give an example, just to give people a sense of what this can do.
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, so this came from, I was talking earlier about learning how to make a really strong, logical argument, or just a strong argument for your point of view, in general. And the sort of fundamental skill for that, in my view, is logical thinking, logical reasoning. And when I think about the best way, we have to test that today, at least ...
Hilary Gridley :
Think about the best way we have to test that today, at least the best is maybe not the right word, but the standard way we have to test that, the LSAT, the test that you take to get into law school, that is what that tests. And it sort of gives you these different scenarios and we'll try to say if a is true, then which of the following is true, is not true? Sort of testing some of these different logical relationships.
:
And so what I did was I made a GPT that I basically told it, "Create LSAT style questions to test logical reasoning, but put them in the scenarios of things that a PM would encounter." And I have a version of this that's very specific to WHOOP and working in consumer health, but you could do it for anything or you can just do generic, however you want to do it.
:
And actually it's kind of fun because it gives you the scenario and it's like, "The sales team is telling you that we need to invest in feature A and the, I don't know, the engineering team is telling you that we only have time to do feature B and the metrics are telling you that people who get this feature retain better." It just sort of gives you these little things and it's like, follow that logic, which is the logically best path from this? And it gives you a little multiple choice answer, you select one and it explains why you're right or wrong.
:
And so I think that's just another example of, you can't create those hyper personalized learnings, where I can make one that is literally so specific to you and your life, but is testing and training you on this broader skill set. And I think you can make things more fun that way, even in just the school context, in terms of doing that in a way that's just relevant to a person's interest, relevant to the things they care about. I think there's a ton of really interesting potential there too.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So we're going to link to this GPT that you're talking about that people can try it out. And once you see it you're like, "Holy shit, I should just be doing this all the time," because you just get so many reps as a product builder.
Hilary Gridley :
And we were talking about a similar one with understanding engineering benchmarks. I don't have an engineering background, so this was really hard for me when I was moving into product, is just getting an instinct for what types of things tend to be easier or harder for engineering teams. And so we can have one similar that's saying, " Here's the scope that's being proposed. If you had to t-shirt size this, which one would you choose and why?" And you can say, "Oh, this sounds, small or whatever." And it'll say, "Oh actually these types of integrations tend to be complex for these reasons. So it's probably going to end up being more like a large."
:
And it doesn't have enough context to really inform you in the way that your tech stack at your company is. Although I guess could build it and give it that information and then it would, that would be cool. You should do that. But again, it's like you do that as a PM, you might get a chance to do that, I don't know, a couple times a week, maybe, maybe less often than that. And when you have this little tool, you can do it infinity times. You can spend an afternoon doing it. And so again, both the speed of those loops and the number of those loops that you're able to get is just radically different with AI compared to just when they come up in the course of your job.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think this is extremely cool. We're going to link to it. People should definitely play with this. Okay, I'm going to take us to two corners, recurring segments, of the podcast and then I want to talk about WHOOP before we get to a very exciting lightning round. So this is a new segment I'm trying out, I'm going to call it Pivotal Corner. And here's the question, what's the most pivotal moment in your career?
Hilary Gridley :
I mean I think it was at my former company, at Big Health, when my former boss left the company and I started reporting to the CEO. And again, I think it was my first time working with a CEO so closely, and it just, definitely trial by fire. But it made me understand so many things that seemed like they didn't make sense to me before, when I was just in the rank and file of a big tech company earlier in my career. You get in the room and you talk to these people and you're like, "Oh, this actually makes sense. I understand why this person has come to these conclusions."
:
And some of it's understanding the pressure they're under. Some of it's understanding, again, the way they view the world. But I think that was, to get to our earlier point around the humility of understanding that maybe this person is right about something that I don't see and maybe I can start by... If I start by giving them the benefit of the doubt, it is not only a nice thing to do, but it is also, it will help me understand why they're doing the things that they are. And I think I would've been so much less frustrated earlier in my career if I understood that instead of just being like, "Oh, this doesn't make any sense from where I'm sitting, so therefore it must not make any sense."
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's so cool that this connects back to your habit of doing this, having seen it, and being like, "Oh, I see, this is why..."
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, I guess I hadn't realized.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I could be wrong.
Hilary Gridley :
Well, I mean that's what it is. I feel like I've had so many of those times where I don't know, when I was growing up, I felt so confident in how I felt about everything. And then you get out there and you're just like, "Oh, I was missing some things." And after a while you're kind of like, "Okay, maybe I should approach these situations a little differently with the possibility that maybe I'm missing something."
Lenny Rachitsky :
So I actually asked your boss Kelvin, which is an awesome name by the way, Kelvin, about this moment. When I asked him what to ask you, and he brought this up actually, and here's the way, described it, "She may describe it as being thrown into the deep end or baptism by fire, but the reality is that she had the core skills and this was simply an opportunity for her to let those shine even more. She was an incredible first principles thinker, quick to tune the framing of problems as she learned more context. It's a great example of luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."
Hilary Gridley :
Thanks Kelvin. That's really nice.
Lenny Rachitsky :
He also said, "I wonder if she remembers how terrified she was now, because she absolutely knocked it out of the park and it felt like it was an inflection point that grew her confidence significantly."
Hilary Gridley :
Oh, I was terrified. Yeah. Big time terrified. And then, I mean this is also what I was saying about why it's so important to be regimented about having these things outside of work that allow you to continue to thrive, even in the face of just utter feelings of failure, of, "I am not doing a good job, this is not going well. I don't know what I'm doing." A lot of it was that time. Kelvin actually gave me some great advice that, this is maybe kind of scary advice, but when I asked him what his advice for me with the time was, and he said, "Product leadership is the type of role where if you are not in control of the voices in your head, they will eat you alive."
:
And I think it's right. As I said, it is so often this feeling like there is not a clear right answer and not even necessarily a good answer. And everyone is looking to you for clarity and everyone is looking to you to make the right decisions and everyone sees the errors, or at least everyone can spot the flaws in whatever decision you make or whatever recommendation you make. And as I said, every path forward has flaws that can be poked in it. And so understanding that the existence of potential ways to be criticized about something does not warrant criticism in a way that can, I think often result in a lot of negative self-talk for people. So yeah, I mean it had a tremendous impact on me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's interesting you have so much of these habits and skills you've built seem to, it's clear where they come from, from all these experiences that you had.
Hilary Gridley :
Well, and to the point of when you start talking to people and you start trying to build this mental model of how they think, that's exactly what you learn, is well, I can see how this person worked at this company at this time and I can see how this person had this kind of relationship with this other person. And all of these things shape the way that we approach problems and the way that we try to just move through the world. And it is understanding those types of things that allow you to understand how a person thinks.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I wonder if you could ask ChatGPT to build, or Claude to build, these mental models. Like, "Here's their LinkedIn, here's their bio, here's a few things, how do they see the world?"
Hilary Gridley :
I will admit that I have tried this. And I think it's a great idea. I think it does help. I have not gotten to a point where I'm comfortable sharing it with other people, nor have I told anyone that I have tried to do this for them, but I've certainly done it for myself. And I think it would be helpful. Because you could say things, you could upload a doc or whatever and be like, "What are the three questions that this person's going to ask me about it?" And then you could be prepared for the questions that person's going to ask you and that's great.
Lenny Rachitsky :
In this hypothetical example, what context do you share with this model to help it be good?
Hilary Gridley :
Great question. Hypothetically, I told you that I take all these notes on, here's what this person said and here's how I interpret it, and LLMs are really good at pattern matching and sort of spotting the... You could feed all of those in and just say, "Come up with the 10 criteria that this person is most likely to use to assess a possible recommendation or path forward," or, "Give me the top 10 ways that this person is likely to pick apart an argument or object to something," and you're going to get a good answer.
Lenny Rachitsky :
More reason to build this habit of taking notes and sharing with your team. On the other hand, this might also be a good use case for Granola or something like that where you have all these meeting notes and you could just feed it, "Here's all the things Hilary said," and, "Oh, what is she probably going to say about this?"
Hilary Gridley :
Totally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow, so cool. Okay, next corner, I'm going to take us to Fail Corner. And in Fail Corner, the idea here is people come on this podcast, they share all these wins and success, everything's up and to the right and amazing, but in reality things don't always go that smoothly. So the question is, is there a story you could share of failure in your career where things didn't go the way you hoped and what you learned from that experience?
Hilary Gridley :
I mean I think the one that probably looms largest in my mind is, I mentioned this depression therapeutic that I spent about a year working on, and ultimately the company ended up acquiring a different depression therapeutic. And we kind of ended up merging the two of them. And a lot of the stuff that we had initially built that I had really loved about this product we were working on didn't really ever end up seeing the light of day beyond the kind of testing that we had done around it. And it was heartbreaking because I wish this product existed. I look at it and I'm like, "This was a great product and we put so much heart and soul into it."
:
And I think the lesson that I learned from that is, I think there's always a shot clock. When you're working, especially on a zero to one product, I think it can be very easy to feel like you have the luxury of time, of just like, we got to take the time to figure this out and get it right and that's what's most important. But the sort of build versus buy question is always live and it's always fair. And whether you want to admit it, if you're the one working on it, and you probably don't, I didn't want to admit this, there is a point at which it makes more sense for the company. If it is taking too long to develop something and there is a solution out there that works, it is the right decision to acquire that.
:
I mean I worked at Dropbox where I saw this happen all the time where we would acquire products that other teams internally had been working on and it's just like, it's heartbreaking when it happens. But I think there's an urgency that that has instilled in me that I think is actually really good and healthy, especially again working in this era where there is kind of this AI arms race and everyone's trying to move really quickly of, yeah, there's always a shot clock. And you might not be aware of it, but it's there, and you got to build your heart out and you got to ship and you got to get things out because at any time, that clock might run out.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Speaking of shot clock, not necessarily, but I want to spend a little time on WHOOP, you guys just launched something that feels like a really big deal. I'm excited. That's the reason I got it. There's all these really cool new features. I think you call it WHOOP 5.0. What should people know? What's the newest, coolest thing that's happening with WHOOP?
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, I'm really excited you got it. I know you tried it before and...
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's right. That's right.
Hilary Gridley :
People who have tried WHOOP in the past maybe felt like it was very focused on elite athletes and that is...
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, that's exactly what I felt.
Hilary Gridley :
Sort of the lifeblood of the company. And I think what we've done with our new experience is we've really built something that can help everyone be healthier and live better. I would say we're no longer just for elite athletes. We're really now a health and performance companion for anybody who wants to feel their best.
:
For the first time in our company's history, we've updated our mission, so we're now saying that WHOOP exists to unlock human performance and health span. And health span I think is, and I mentioned earlier this feature I'm really excited about, because I do think it is kind of the most powerful version of a longevity-type feature I have seen because it is so focused on your behaviors and your habits today.
:
And we built it to be super, super actionable. So rather than just giving you a score that you're kind of like, "Okay, that's nice," if you start sleeping even 20 minutes more, 30 minutes more tonight, you're going to see how that changes your case of aging. You're going to see how that changes your WHOOP age. And I think that, as I mentioned earlier, I think is really rewarding.
:
We also have a lot of personalized coaching through our AI in terms of actions that you can take to improve your WHOOP age, to improve your sleep, to feel better, and it's all part of our broader aim to make health more actionable and accessible. I think one thing I'm really excited about is we have a bunch of new women's health features, so we have hormonal insights with improved menstrual cycle tracking. I'm actually pregnant and I-
Lenny Rachitsky :
What? I didn't know that. That's a big announcement. Wow. Congratulations Hilary. That's so exciting.
Hilary Gridley :
But actually part of how I found out I was pregnant was in seeing my WHOOP data.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What? What? That's insane.
Hilary Gridley :
In my WHOOP data, which is pretty remarkable.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow.
Hilary Gridley :
And the way that we have this cycle tracking now, you can see the way that your different, your HRV, your resting heart rate, things like that, that's your heart rate variability and your resting heart rate, fluctuates throughout different times of your cycle. And even in the time leading up to that, I had a not straightforward pregnancy journey, and having these tools to really understand what was going on in my body was tremendously helpful and tremendously empowering for me and honestly really has changed my life. So I'm really excited about that.
:
We have a lot of great new heart health features. We have a heart health screener with blood pressure insights and ECG. That's really cool. We got a lot of great stuff cooking. So even if you tried WHOOP in the past and thought it wasn't for you, I think the new experience is a real upgrade and it's something that I'm deeply proud of having worked on and really excited to have out in the world.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I am genuinely very excited about this. You could do, you said blood pressure and VO2 max?
Hilary Gridley :
Mm-hmm.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And I know the battery is even longer too. There's just so much stuff.
Hilary Gridley :
Oh, we have a 14 day battery life. I didn't even say. We have these beautiful new leather bands which I love.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh wow.
Hilary Gridley :
Okay. 14 day battery's life is insane. I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I don't even need to bring a charger. This is fantastic.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh man. This sounds like a WHOOP ad, but I'm very excited about this.
Hilary Gridley :
I'll say one more thing, which is we've opened a wait list for Advanced Labs and so pretty soon you're going to be able to have comprehensive lab work in the app, and I think we talk about the future of health, of having control of all of your health data in one place, and then being able to not just sort of find the signal in it and understand how your sleep is impacting your metabolic health or things like that. But again, get really actionable coaching on actions that you can take to feel better and be your healthiest and just pushing the limits of all the data that we're pulling into the WHOOP ecosystem. So really excited about that too.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm hoping the WHOOP can actually take my blood and labs. Is that where this is going? Because that'd be so convenient.
Hilary Gridley :
No comment.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. It'd be weird but also awesome. I don't have to go anywhere to do that. Hilary, we covered so much ground. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on? Anything else that we haven't covered that you think, or last nugget you wanted to leave listeners with?
Hilary Gridley :
I don't think so. I feel like we covered everything
Lenny Rachitsky :
We did. We covered so much. In the best way possible. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Hilary Gridley :
I'm ready.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
Hilary Gridley :
Buddy, you can't call something a lightning round and then ask me about books. We could go for a whole other podcast where I'm like...
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's recreate a time box for it.
Hilary Gridley :
Yeah, exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Lightning round.
Hilary Gridley :
Okay, I'm going to, hearing what I'm going to say, I'm going to go full fiction on this. I'm going to say if you're going to read a book, don't bother reading a business book. Even the business books I love the most that shaped how I think I'm like, "I kind of got the gist of them part way through," but fiction, I'm like, everybody should read East of Eden by John Steinbeck and everybody should read The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway, which is my comfort book.
:
I think what I love about fiction is it teaches you how to sit inside tension. I think so much of working in product is, as I said, you're in this fog and you just have to provide clarity and you have to be really good at providing structure to ambiguous things and finding the way forward and to succeed at the job, you have to be able to do that. But I also think to succeed as a human in the job, you have to be able to sit in the mess and sit in the ambiguity. John Keats, the poet, talks about this concept of negative capability, which is the ability to remain in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason. And I love that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That sounds like a perfect quote for all PMs to...
Hilary Gridley :
Exactly. And you got to be both, right. Again, fiction, I love dualities. There's a lot of dualities in fiction, a lot of warring forces within people that can be so driving for people but can also be the source of so much anguish. I think it is important to live in both. In the, "I'm going to break down this problem, I'm going to structure it, I'm going to get out, but also I'm going to sit here and I'm going to accept that there is no right answer and there is no perfect answer." And that's life. You don't learn that from... To the extent that you learn that from a book at all, which maybe you don't, but I think you can learn it in fiction.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I don't know how you feel about this book. I think you'll be proud of me. I'm reading Anna Karenina right now.
Hilary Gridley :
Oh, literally that's the book that I'm bringing on vacation with me tomorrow.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. You've never read it?
Hilary Gridley :
I've never read it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Cool. Me neither. Okay, we'll exchange some notes. It's very long I'm realizing. Because I'm reading on the Kindle, and only 12%. Okay.
Hilary Gridley :
Now I really have to read it. I was kind of wavering. I was like, "Is this really what I'm going to want to read when I'm sitting by the pool?" But no, I've committed.
Lenny Rachitsky :
You got to do it. Another guest recommended it and I saw it on some lists recently and then like, "Oh, I should read that." So yeah. Okay, great. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Hilary Gridley :
I've been watching The Rehearsal with Nathan Fielder. Have you seen this show?
Lenny Rachitsky :
I saw the first season. I've been a huge fan of Nathan Fielder for so long. I don't know if you saw his previous thing that he did, I forget what it's called.
Hilary Gridley :
Oh yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. He's so hilarious and such a genius.
Hilary Gridley :
Nathan for You.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Nathan for You? Oh my God. I haven't seen the new season, no.
Hilary Gridley :
The man is a freaking genius. Just when I thought that I had a good sense of all the human emotions that exist out there, I watch the show and I feel things that I'm like, I feel like 10 different things.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Duality.
Hilary Gridley :
And I'm like, "I have no words for any of the things that I'm feeling right now." It's weird. It's weird stuff, but I'm enjoying it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I got to watch it. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really enjoyed? Other than the WHOOP.
Hilary Gridley :
I love my Zwift. It's like a program that you can hook up a smart trainer to for an indoor cycling situation. And you kind of bike around like you're in Mario Kart and you're sort of in these virtual worlds biking with other people. It's I think for very serious cyclists, I'm not a very serious cyclist. For me, it's been amazing as somebody who actually really struggles to find time to exercise.
:
They have, speak of reward loops, they have one of the most amazing reward loops, which is you're biking along and you get into this track and a ghost of your previous self breaks out from you and starts racing alongside you at your personal best for that track. And you have to beat your personal self, or you have to beat this ghost version of yourself. And nothing has ever motivated me more in my life than past Hilary being like, "I'm coming for you." And I'm like... I don't get that competitive with other people, but past Hilary comes for me and I'm like, "This, I can't let happen." So I think it's a great product.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm thinking about how to use that, I don't know, mode for other use cases, like the ghost version of something to motivate you essentially. Interesting.
Hilary Gridley :

**I've been in so many product meetings where I'm like, "Can we make a ghost version of yourself?" [inaudible 01**:

49:21]
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. They're like, "Shut up about the ghost." Okay, amazing. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life?
Hilary Gridley :
I'll say one that's been top of mind for me recently, because I was talking about the high brow fiction. I also have to go low brow. I saw this clip of Beavis and Butthead online recently where they were watching a music video for Creep by Radiohead. And it starts off really slow and one of them, I think maybe Butthead, is like, "Oh, this sucks." And then the chorus comes and it starts getting all hyped and they're like, "Oh, this rocks, this rocks." And then, I'm not going to do my Beavis and Butthead impression. So then it gets back to the slow part and they're like, "Oh wait, this sucks again." And then Butthead is like, "Why don't they just play the cool part the entire time?" And Beavis is like, "Because if they didn't have the part of the song that sucked, the cool part wouldn't be as cool."
:
And I was like, "That is so profound." That is what life is all about, is just if it didn't have the parts that sucked, the cool parts wouldn't be as cool. And we're always chasing the cool parts. We want it all to be the cool parts, but it can't. So thank you Beavis and Butthead.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Thank you Beavis and Butthead. Okay, final question. I love that you're talking about fiction books. This is where my question was going to go. What's a fiction book that most impacted your product building approach or career or the way you think about product?
Hilary Gridley :
Can I give a poem?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Absolutely. Even better. Poem, extra credit.
Hilary Gridley :
There's a poem by Derek Walcott about, it's called Sea Grapes, and it's about Odysseus, and he talks about Odysseus being driven by the ancient war between obsession and responsibility. And I read that line when I was 18 years old and it has always stuck with me. And I sort of mentioned earlier, I think about these dualities that drive us. And I think as a product person, I always feel like I'm living between these two, the obsession and the responsibility. I want to go so deep on this and I want to spend as much time as I possibly can just sorting every little piece out.
:
But we live in a society, we exist in a business. I am trying to create value for shareholders and trying to bring these two things together, I feel like a, has been the kind of defining struggle of my career, I think of many people's careers, is how you have something that you feel like you can really obsess over and have that flow over, or have that flow when you're working on. But then it's got to kind of work in this broader system as well. And I think that's sort of been the thing that I think of as the guiding post for what I want to do with my career and with my life. So I think it's got to be Derek Walcott.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What a beautiful way to end it. Hilary, two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe follow up on stuff that you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Hilary Gridley :
Great, thank you. So as I mentioned, I have a newsletter, it's hils.substack.com. That's hils.substack.com. I'm also teaching a Maven class on being a super manager with AI. So if you were listening to all this and you were like, "Oh Hilary, that sounds so great, but I don't have time for any of that. How do you have time for all that?" Honestly, hyper-leveraging myself with AI has been a big part of how I find time to do any of this stuff. And so I share a bunch about how I do that, how I use AI as a manager, building on a lot of the stuff that I shared on Claire's podcast as well, How I AI. So you can find me on Maven there. We've got a couple of cohorts coming up.
:
And then, yeah, I encourage everyone to try out WHOOP, you can get a free month on me at join.whoop.com/hilary, that's Hilary with one L. And you can post at me or tweet at me on X and let me know what you think of it. And I would love everyone's feedback because we're really excited about it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
As you were talking, I looked up your course just for make sure people can find it. So you go to maven.com, you just search for Hilary Gridley and you'll find it.
Hilary Gridley :
Yep. And you can also, I realize that if you Google super manager, you will find me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Whoa.
Hilary Gridley :
So that is my new claim to fame.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh my God, that's so great. 4.9 stars. Holy moly. There we go. Okay, Hilary, thank you so much. This was incredible. Covered everything I was hoping to, this was everything I wanted it to be. Thank you so much for being here.
Hilary Gridley :
Thank you. Thank you for having me. This was so fun.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So fun. Bye everyone.
