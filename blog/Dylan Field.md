## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### You can't do this anymore, first of all, because the Twitter API doesn't exist anymore. Rest in peace, Twitter API. But look, I was an intern at LinkedIn and when I was there I saw some really cool work people had done with Gephi, which was a network visualization tool. And based on that I thought it'd be interesting to try to, like you said, look at who the design network was, who the central nodes were, which you can just run [inaudible 00

31:31] on and see. And you could do that for other communities too, which I have done in the past just because I'm curious about social network dynamics and social network analysis.
(31:42):
And you could just do those things back in 2012, 2013 when Figma started. So I constructed this list of, "Here are the most central designers in the graph", but also then I looked at their work. And the ones that I was really inspired by as a total fanboy, and someone who wanted to learn as much as I could a...

### One example is Tim Van Damme. I saw him on Dribble. Max [inaudible 00

32:35], I'm like, "Oh, my God, this guy is just genius. These icons are incredible." I think the first time I met Tim was at Dropbox and think I had this total fanboy moment. I'm like, "I've been tracing your icons." He's like, "Hi."
(32:54):
And I had been working on vector networks with a team, and my test cases were a lot of his icons. Because they were just beautiful and I liked looking at them and studying them. And to now have Tim on the team and have him doing the icons for UI 3 is such a...

### Well, I think it especially works for designers that way, because designers are really good at giving feedback. It turns out that not everyone is good at giving feedback, but designers are awesome at that. So we're really lucky. And literally early on in Figma's existence, folks... I think Payam [inaudible 00

34:00] is here somewhere. I'm not sure if he's in this room, but I was hoping to see him before the end of Config. Payam wrote a very long doc for us about all the things that he wanted to see in Figma after we did a user research study with him. With a bottle of wine because our text editing didn't work very well then. So I ran him through the user study, I knew we'd need a bottle of wine to finish and it took hours. The type of sentence in Figma was so slow.
Lenny Rachitsky (34:27):
That remin...

### Well, no, one thing I'll share is I think we're so early on this journey of computing in general. And in our lifetimes, we're going to have the chance to just build such incredible technology and incredible products. And I'm really excited to see what everyone in this room builds, but also everyone on the internet that [inaudible 00

43:48] maybe also builds and send me cool stuff. If you build something cool, message me somewhere and share it with me.
Lenny Rachitsky (43:56):
What's the best way to message you?
Dylan Field (43:59):
Email's good. You can probably figure out my email if you-
Lenny Rachitsky (43:59):
Just use websim.
Dylan Field (44:03):

### ... [inaudible 00

44:03] for five seconds or use websim. Twitter/X is good. Those are two places at least you can find me.
Lenny Rachitsky (44:12):
Dylan, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We only have a couple of minutes left. It's a very short one. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love other than websim?
Dylan Field (44:28):
Well, I'll say that, and it's not like a favorite product, but I will say that if you get... Hesitate if I should say...

## Full Conversation | 完整对话

*Below is the complete transcript of the conversation.*

*以下是完整对话记录。*

**Oh, gosh. Well, I think probably anyone here who's worked on product knows how hard it is. I think the more that you add, the harder it is to create something that's coherent. One essay that Evan, my co-founder, introduced me to early on in famous history, I think from Stevie's [inaudible 00**:

23:06] grants or something like that, contains the term irreducible complexity. And it's basically this idea that one plus one does not equal three, it sometimes equals one and a half. And the more that you add and the more that you continue to put in something, the more complex it gets and the worse it gets. And I think this is definitely true for tools.
(23:28):
So in the context of Figma, we can make it more powerful, but to do that in a way that's not making it more complex at the same time is extremely hard. And we have to always be paying attention to how complex or how simple things are because if we don't, it just becomes a monstrosity really fast. And there's parts of our product that, I don't want to dive into that part of the conversation, the self-critique, but definitely as I'm in conversation with a bunch of our product leaders at Figma, there's parts where it's like, "Okay, this thing is too complex as a system and we made all the right local decisions and yet together they're too complex and they're not working anymore. And let's go revisit the system now."

(24:59):
I know you just redesigned Figma. I imagine part of that came from things are just getting too complicated, not as simple as we want. Is there anything that's been bugging you in the old Figma but like, "Oh, this is way too complicated, I really want to simplify this thing"?
Dylan Field (25:09):
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky (25:11):
What's that?
Dylan Field (25:12):
We'll move on, but many things.
Lenny Rachitsky (25:18):
Sounds good. And in terms of how to keep things simple, so I had Dharmesh Shah on the podcast, he's the co-founder of HubSpot, and the way he described it is that you're always fighting the second loft through more dynamics of entropy, just the product getting more complicated. And he sees himself as part of the solution, of top down, you have to be on top of that. Is that the way you see it? That's your role, to keep things simple. Do you think people further down the ladder can do that?
Dylan Field (25:46):
Absolutely, everyone's responsible for simplicity. And I think another quote that is not mine but is a really a good one is "Keep the simple things simple. Make the complex things possible." And I think that's a really important principle to hold as you're designing tools. And I'd say that it's really easy to make the simple things complex, unfortunately.
Lenny Rachitsky (26:10):
I want to pivot to talking about early days Figma. So I don't know how many people know this, but it took three and a half years to launch Figma from when you were beginning to work on it.
Dylan Field (26:19):
Way too long, don't do that.
Lenny Rachitsky (26:22):
This is my question. So it took three and a half years to launch and then five years to get your first customer. Dylan, what the hell were you doing all that time?
Dylan Field (26:28):
I don't think it took five years for a first... Well okay-
Lenny Rachitsky (26:32):
Paying.
Dylan Field (26:33):
First paying customer, sure. Okay, fine. Slightly less but approximately five years, it gets to be round up. I think that if I had been probably better at hiring and recruiting... I see Nadia in the audience, making eye contact with her the entire time, for some reason. She's our chief people officer. If she had been at Figma from day one, we would've hired probably faster and we would've gotten to market faster. But I think that it was a hard product to build and to get everything to come together with. I also see Sho. And I think for... Sho's joined us as a director of engineering. He's a VP of product now. Again, people can wear many hats. And he was someone that joined Figma and said, "Hey, y'all need to ship this thing, you're really close." And he really helped catalyze us to ship in that moment. And I think, in week one, he gave a presentation. It was like, "Here's what we got to do, here's the gap. Everyone agrees on it. Let's go."
Lenny Rachitsky (27:45):
You already said that you wish you shipped earlier. Is there any advice there for just people building something today of-
Dylan Field (27:49):
Get it out as fast as you possibly can. Everything they tell you about making sure that you get a product out really quickly is totally true. The faster you get it out, the more feedback you get. That is a positive thing. And now I index on that when we try to build. And FigJam's a great example of that, we shipped it incredibly fast and it helped us get to market and get feedback faster. Figma Slides, great example of that too. Dev Mode, for what it's worth, it took us longer. We just had to keep iterating and building it and building it again. Certain directions we tried didn't work out and we really had to get to a place where we were able to really believe that we were adding value and really understood the developer's user, and it just didn't happen for a long time. So it's interesting because I think people look at Dev Mode and sometimes they go, "Oh, this is quite simple", to the point about simplicity.
(28:53):
Figma, is this simpler than FigJam? And the reality was it took at least three times as long.
Lenny Rachitsky (29:04):
So your advice is ship quickly. There's also this push the-
Dylan Field (29:09):
I'd hold the bar, for sure.
Lenny Rachitsky (29:11):
That's the question I have, is there's also a lot of talk of just the bar has risen. You need, especially B2B software, craft is really important. Linear talks a lot about this, just the bar is very high for people to switch from something out there. Is there anything... I don't think you'll have, "Here's the answer. When you're ready to ship...", but just any advice of just like, "Here's good enough" versus "No, you should probably wait."
Dylan Field (29:32):
Well, another thing that Evan taught me was that for a new launch, you got quality, features, deadline, choose two. And I think that the beautiful thing about software is you can keep iterating on it. So it's not like a physical product where you have to always have quality in there, otherwise it's never going to have quality. You can ship it with features and deadline and then improve it iteratively over time. I'm not saying you should always do that. Sometimes you need to at least have a minimum bar of quality for the things you have and you're going to ship less features maybe.
(30:04):
So you choose quality and deadline and sometimes you say, "Actually here's the minimum feature set and we're going to have this quality bar and you're willing to push it out." But I think you have to know when you're introducing a new thing, what it's going to take and then to make that minimally awesome product. But also I think that when you're iteratively improving it, you shouldn't just be focused on the features, you have to focus on the quality too.
Lenny Rachitsky (30:33):
I like this term you use, 'minimally awesome product'. Love it. So the way you got your early users for Figma is quite fascinating. I don't know how many people know this story, but you basically wrote a script to scrape Twitter and create a graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and then you made it your mission to convince them to use Figma and make them evangelists. Is there anything more to the story there? And then I have a question along those lines.
Dylan Field (31:01):

**You can't do this anymore, first of all, because the Twitter API doesn't exist anymore. Rest in peace, Twitter API. But look, I was an intern at LinkedIn and when I was there I saw some really cool work people had done with Gephi, which was a network visualization tool. And based on that I thought it'd be interesting to try to, like you said, look at who the design network was, who the central nodes were, which you can just run [inaudible 00**:

31:31] on and see. And you could do that for other communities too, which I have done in the past just because I'm curious about social network dynamics and social network analysis.
(31:42):
And you could just do those things back in 2012, 2013 when Figma started. So I constructed this list of, "Here are the most central designers in the graph", but also then I looked at their work. And the ones that I was really inspired by as a total fanboy, and someone who wanted to learn as much as I could about design, was inspired by these folks, the ones I was inspired by I reached out to and said, "Hey, can I buy you a coffee?" And most of them are really kind. The design community is amazing. And they said yes and then from there was able to learn from them, show them Figma, get their feedback. And I think it started honestly more as me fanboy and me getting feedback.
(32:29):

**One example is Tim Van Damme. I saw him on Dribble. Max [inaudible 00**:

32:35], I'm like, "Oh, my God, this guy is just genius. These icons are incredible." I think the first time I met Tim was at Dropbox and think I had this total fanboy moment. I'm like, "I've been tracing your icons." He's like, "Hi."
(32:54):
And I had been working on vector networks with a team, and my test cases were a lot of his icons. Because they were just beautiful and I liked looking at them and studying them. And to now have Tim on the team and have him doing the icons for UI 3 is such an honor, and privileged to work with someone of that craft. So reaching out to your hero sometimes works.
Lenny Rachitsky (33:24):
It's interesting because when people hear that story, when I've heard that story many times, it was always like, "Here's a growth hack. Find the most influential people in your field, go try to convince them to use your product." And the way you're describing it is you were using it more as feedback. "I just want to show you the product, get your feedback, make this better", and then it ended up working. They're like, "Oh, I love Figma, I'm going to use it."
Dylan Field (33:43):

**Well, I think it especially works for designers that way, because designers are really good at giving feedback. It turns out that not everyone is good at giving feedback, but designers are awesome at that. So we're really lucky. And literally early on in Figma's existence, folks... I think Payam [inaudible 00**:

34:00] is here somewhere. I'm not sure if he's in this room, but I was hoping to see him before the end of Config. Payam wrote a very long doc for us about all the things that he wanted to see in Figma after we did a user research study with him. With a bottle of wine because our text editing didn't work very well then. So I ran him through the user study, I knew we'd need a bottle of wine to finish and it took hours. The type of sentence in Figma was so slow.
Lenny Rachitsky (34:27):
That reminds me of a story I've heard where... One of your first customers was Coda, sponsor I think of Config. It used to be called Krypton. And there's a story where you installed Figma, you helped them get set up, you drove home and then they called you like, "Hey, Figma is not working anymore." And you drove back yourself to help fix them and it ended up their wifi was down or there was a wifi issue. Is that the story?
Dylan Field (34:53):
I don't remember what the solution was, but-
Lenny Rachitsky (34:54):
That's what I heard.
Dylan Field (34:56):
... we were halfway home and somehow I saw... I'm sure I was not looking at my email while driving, definitely is not something anyone here should do. But somehow found out that they had an issue and we turned the car around. Shishir is amazing by the way, and has been a mentor for a long time to me and many people on our team. And he, I think, at the time did not know he was the first customer.
(35:27):
And later on he came over to Figma's office and I introduced him without really thinking about that. And I was like, "This is Shishir, he's team was really the first user of Figma as a team." And he goes, "Wait a second, I am?"
Lenny Rachitsky (35:48):
I want to talk about something totally different. Something I've noticed you are good at is you spot trends ahead of other people. So obviously WebGL you were on early and that's what allowed Figma to exist, to link it in the browser. I saw you tweeting about CryptoPunks way before they were worth millions of dollars. You're just like, "Look, CryptoPunks. Look, I got a few, they're really cool. They're super cool, little pipe." I'm curious if there's anything these days you're really excited about that might become bigger in the future?
Dylan Field (36:15):
Well, we talked about websim. We were just talking about them backstage and I think before this conversation too.
Lenny Rachitsky (36:23):
Talk about websim.
Dylan Field (36:24):
And that's an example of something where it's so interesting because there's a generative UI component and yet it's not what we're going for, for Figma, it's totally different. So we actually invested in websim with Figma Ventures.
Lenny Rachitsky (36:39):
Maybe explain what websim is for folks.
Dylan Field (36:41):
Websim is a hallucinated internet basically. If you go to websim.ai, you can use different models like Claude or GPT-4o, and you can do that either through their defaults or you can use open router to get a bigger context window. And the more that you use it, the more you construct this context window of this almost universe that you're building up in websim. And as you do it, it's almost like you're world building. And I just have gone deep and geeked out on this when I've had time, and they've evolved the platform a lot.
(37:21):
So we were back there and they were showing me some new functionality that's really cool too. But I think it's so interesting to see it as this almost lean forward entertainment tool using the internet.
Lenny Rachitsky (37:36):
So I thought you would answer this and so we're going to have a picture come up here, that I tried websim and played around with it. And hopefully a photo comes up somewhere. So all I typed here was gmail.com/dylanfield. So this is in an invented Gmail. Just came up with this using AI of what your inbox should look like and it looks pretty accurate. There's Adobe stuff-
Dylan Field (38:00):
DOJ, not FTC.
Lenny Rachitsky (38:02):
... financial. This is not actual information. Nobody buy stock based on this. So it's pretty-
Dylan Field (38:09):
No comment on 75% year over year.
Lenny Rachitsky (38:13):
So the way it work-
Dylan Field (38:14):
I hadn't ever tried Gmail before. Did you try you? What was your inbox?
Lenny Rachitsky (38:18):
I didn't do me. I don't think it would have anything. It'd be like, if it does-
Dylan Field (38:21):
Who are you?
Lenny Rachitsky (38:22):
So the way it works is just you type a URL or a prompt in the URL field and it'll just invent what that website looks like. It's hilarious.
Dylan Field (38:29):
It's awesome.
Lenny Rachitsky (38:30):
It's awesome. So I think they're going to get a lot of traffic right now.
Dylan Field (38:32):
One time someone posted in our random channel on Slack, they said, "I had a dream last night." It's always a good start for the random channel. "I had a dream last night that I was working on FigJam, but it wasn't FigJam, it was Frog Jam.
(38:52):
And websim was like figma.com/frogjam and it came up with a whole marketing website complete with toad puns for Frog Jam. The sticky notes were lily pads and you were supposed to... It had this whole metaphor of hopping from lily pad to lily pad to generate new ideas.
Lenny Rachitsky (39:17):
This is genius. Interestingly, before Figma, your only other job was an intern at three different companies and now you're leading this juggernaut of a business, a thousand plus people. I imagine there's a lot you've had to learn over this time. So I'm not going to ask you what you've learned because I think it's probably a lot. I'm curious just what has most helped you scale and learn? Is it exec coaches, is it co friends? Is it hiring execs? What's most helped you scale with the business and become the leader you are today?
Dylan Field (39:51):
I think all the above. And also just having a mindset of, you have to constantly adapt and grow and change and adapt. But I would say that mentors can come from anywhere. It can come from the community, all of you. Mentorship can come from the people you hire. It can come from folks that you actively seek out as investors or explicit mentorship and mentors. It can come from people that call themselves coaches. And what's interesting too is it can come from people you mentor as well. There have been plenty of people where they ask me a question at some point and I give them an answer and they think it's insightful for whatever reason. And then years later where we're talking again and I ask them a question and they're like, "Well, years ago you told me..." And they repeat back what I told them like, "That's a really good point."
(40:45):
Or they've grown and they've changed and they've learned and they tell me something completely different. They give me a new framework. And so I think that when you're... A lot of times when I talk with new founders, they teach me things that are totally things that I've just never thought about. Or interns at Figma have been mentors to me, in many ways. So you really have to have a ready mindset and just always be ready to absorb new information, I think.
Lenny Rachitsky (41:09):
When you were just tinkering around with Figma 12 years ago, I think at this point, did you ever imagine you'd be running a thousand person company and audience just spell bound by what you're building? There's people lining up to take photos with your logo in the lobby. That doesn't happen. That's very rare. Just to give you a chance to reflect on just how it feels to have built that over time, how does that feel? I'm sitting here right now.
Dylan Field (41:32):
I feel very, very lucky, but also very humbled by just the community that is around Figma. I mentioned in the keynote, but just the people that are in the Figma community are the people that are shaping the world's technology. And the chance to serve them and to make software for them and hopefully improve their life in some little way is such a privilege. It's a responsibility and one I don't take lightly, but also I try not to carry that as a weight, but rather as pump me up and get me excited to go build for them.
Lenny Rachitsky (42:10):
When we were talking about this idea earlier... The first thing you said is it's a responsibility, which I didn't expect. Is there anything more there just like, "Wow, I really have to help make..."?
Dylan Field (42:19):
Well, again, going back to the simplification point, it's very important that we continue to make Figma more and more simple. We make Figma as powerful as we can for the people that are in our community. That we figure out what people's needs truly are and that we advance the state of the craft, make it so that we do that in a responsible way. And that we champion design and champion quality. So we're trying to do all those things. We sometimes mess up, but people have been very patient with us and we're very thankful for that. And thankful for the support of just everyone here and in our community that are giving us a chance to make this impact.
Lenny Rachitsky (43:06):
Is there anything else you want to... Oh, there's some applause. Love that.
Dylan Field (43:11):
Thank you.
Lenny Rachitsky (43:15):
Applause break. Is there anything else you want to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very quick lightning round?
Dylan Field (43:24):

**Well, no, one thing I'll share is I think we're so early on this journey of computing in general. And in our lifetimes, we're going to have the chance to just build such incredible technology and incredible products. And I'm really excited to see what everyone in this room builds, but also everyone on the internet that [inaudible 00**:

Lenny Rachitsky (43:56):

Dylan Field (43:59):

Lenny Rachitsky (43:59):

Dylan Field (44:03):

**... [inaudible 00**:

44:03] for five seconds or use websim. Twitter/X is good. Those are two places at least you can find me.
Lenny Rachitsky (44:12):
Dylan, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We only have a couple of minutes left. It's a very short one. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love other than websim?
Dylan Field (44:28):
Well, I'll say that, and it's not like a favorite product, but I will say that if you get... Hesitate if I should say this or not.
Lenny Rachitsky (44:45):
We'll cut it out in post, don't worry about it.
Dylan Field (44:52):
I'll say this, it's so fascinating to look at all the different LMs out there right now and what each one is uniquely good at. And it's really fun if you can hack them the right way and get them in the right mood, what they'll do. That's what I'll say.
Lenny Rachitsky (45:07):
Whoa, what does that mean?
Dylan Field (45:11):
It's my diplomatic answer.
Lenny Rachitsky (45:13):
Interesting. Do you have a favorite life motto that you come back to, repeat to yourself, share with friends or family, that you find really useful?
Dylan Field (45:22):
I don't know if I've got a life motto, but one piece of advice I've always appreciated is when people give you advice, they're not giving you advice, they're giving themselves advice in your shoes. I think that's an interesting one. So if I gave you advice here, I'm giving myself advice in your shoes.
Lenny Rachitsky (45:41):
Final question. Not many people know this, but you were a child actor when you were five years old. Do you think you made the right career move? Do you feel like you sometimes regret acting?
Dylan Field (45:54):
Yes, definitely. That's my mom. My mom's in the audience and she says yes. No. We've been talking about product. If you're an actor, you're a product in some way. And that's not to disparage actors, actors are awesome. Acting is awesome. I loved it. But my differentiators when I was five, five and a half I think, was that I could read and I could sit still and I was decently cute. And I hit puberty and those things were no longer differentiators. And then it was like, let's do some computer science.
Lenny Rachitsky (46:38):
So to close, we're going to play a... Oh, applause. We're going to play a clip, something I found on YouTube to close and enjoy. 30 seconds clip.
Speaker 5 (47:09):
Where will you find a world of ideas for your child? Only at eToys. From Barbie to Brio to SwimWays. eToys, where great ideas come to you.
Dylan Field (47:22):
That was a good find. Thank you.
Speaker 5 (47:27):
Dylan, thank you so much for doing this.
Dylan Field (47:28):
Thank you. Can I make one comment about that commercial?
Lenny Rachitsky (47:31):
Okay, one comment.
Dylan Field (47:32):
One comment before we end. That commercial made that company go bankrupt. Thank you all for joining. Thank you for having me, Lenny.
Lenny Rachitsky (47:40):
Good luck. Thanks Dylan. Bye everyone.
