## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### [inaudible 00

30:11] a larger company would say, "Look, we'll put you in our queue and you'll be on our... We'll get to you." I think this is... And by the way, this is part of the fun, frankly, of being in a startup because you're so close to the action, because there's nothing between you and the action. So why wouldn't you do that?
Lenny :

### Yeah, and I think one of the takeaways I've had for my own research into this is that you need to find one company that just loves you. It's not like "[inaudible 00

30:37], this is cool." It's like, "I love this product. I would never want to give it up."
Geoffrey Moore :
That's kind of what I meant by that marquee ref... We sometimes we call it a radiating reference. It's just somebody really, we talk about you when you're not even in the room. Yeah, very cool.
Lenny :
We've talked about this idea of the chasm and Crossing the Chasm, but it might be helpful just to explain what is the idea, what is this chasm? What is it that people fall into and why is th...

### So that's number one. Number two, "Can you demo the technology?" You have to be able to demo thing. And then three, "Can you create a vision which says what forces are going to release?" And the concept that we use in venture, I call it trapped value. And with the idea is where's the trap value that this innovation would release? Because when you release trapped value, the world will give you a portion of the gain, typically 10%. It's easy an number to do math with. As I said, I'm an English major. So if you want a billion-dollar company, you better find $10 billion worth of trapped value that your technology could- [inaudible 00

45:30]
Lenny :
Airbnb is an amazing example of that, right? Where they unlocked people's homes, basically 10%-
Geoffrey Moore :
Yeah. Uber unlocked their backseat of the car. By the way, the free labor force, it was like, "Whoa." Okay, so really cool idea early market fund. For the bowling alley one then the playbook is, "No, where's the problem?" And then you got to take it down to in what geography, what industry, what profession, what use case. And that takes... That's not just... I mean, you...

### So in the nineties, we saw a lot of tornado, gorilla play. Cisco, Intel, Oracle, obviously Microsoft. I mean these companies, [inaudible 00

55:36], they were all incredibly competitive companies. They were all tornado plays. Between client server and the internet, it just created this massive tornado effect. And that game plan is very competitive sales to grab market share. And then at some point, if you're not number one, then you have to kind of do a defensive maneuver and retreat into a niche and say, "Okay, if I can't be a gorilla, I at least need to be a chimp." And a chimp is like a local gorilla. "I'm not the gorilla, but..."...

### [inaudible 00

56:28] is happening. I like that. That's good news. So one of the most interesting lessons you teach is also that these playbooks don't work together well. Basically if you use one in the wrong phase, it's the opposite. It has the opposite effect. So before we get there, let me just summarize maybe quickly the playbook in each of these four. I have some notes here and then maybe just talk about why is it that they fail if you pick the wrong one. So in the early market, you're looking for a visio...

### Yes. By the way, why did I leave? [inaudible 01

16:28] County was a great place to be, but I had to do my own thing.
Lenny :
And that's a real pull. Kind of along the lines of something you just shared, maybe a final question. Is there something you've changed your mind about or something you've evolved your thinking on recently? Either from the beginning of the book or just even more recent?
Geoffrey Moore :
I think what I realized over time increasingly was this is a model that's really optimized for B2B markets, because it implies federate...

**[inaudible 00**:

30:11] a larger company would say, "Look, we'll put you in our queue and you'll be on our... We'll get to you." I think this is... And by the way, this is part of the fun, frankly, of being in a startup because you're so close to the action, because there's nothing between you and the action. So why wouldn't you do that?
Lenny :

**Yeah, and I think one of the takeaways I've had for my own research into this is that you need to find one company that just loves you. It's not like "[inaudible 00**:

30:37], this is cool." It's like, "I love this product. I would never want to give it up."
Geoffrey Moore :
That's kind of what I meant by that marquee ref... We sometimes we call it a radiating reference. It's just somebody really, we talk about you when you're not even in the room. Yeah, very cool.
Lenny :
We've talked about this idea of the chasm and Crossing the Chasm, but it might be helpful just to explain what is the idea, what is this chasm? What is it that people fall into and why is this important?
Geoffrey Moore :
And this was funny, because I was working at Regis McKenna, which was this marketing agency that was sort of the premier high-tech marketing agency in the eighties. And we had all these really successful launches, and then covers of front page articles on Fortune magazine and Wall Street Journal. And then a couple of years later it's like, "Well, what happened to these guys?" So that's where the chasm was like... That's what caused the investigation. What we learned was visionaries make their own buying decisions, and they do not consult their peers. In fact, if their peers are doing it, they're probably not going to do it because they want to be different. So basically these companies were having success capturing the imagination of the visionary, and they thought, "Well, I'll use the visionaries as a reference to get the pragmatist."
:
The pragmatist looks at the visionary and goes, "That's not my guy. First of all, he thinks I'm dumb. He thinks he's smarter than I am. Second of all, he does stuff that I would never do, and he makes decisions in a way that I would never make them. So that's not... No. So but I am interested in talking to my peers, but the problem now is, well, which of the peers are going to go first?" And it was kind of like the junior high dance problem. How do you get the party started? So that was the chasm. That was what created the chasm. The pragmatists need references and they will not accept a visionary as a reference, and they don't have any peers that have tried it yet. So that was what was happening.
Lenny :
I think that's such an important point that I think people don't quite always get that that reference, marques customer needs to be a pragmatist. It can't be one of these early adopters that are just trying stuff. And these other pragmatists need to feel that this is my person, this is just like me. And they love it.
Geoffrey Moore :
By the way, one of the reasons that pragmatists have a certain... It's not contempt for visionaries, but it's definitely wariness, it's because often they have to clean up the messes that these guys leave behind because when you're a visionary, you leave a lot of messes in your wake. And then the pragmatist has to come in and clean it up. So they're going, "Oh, that's another mark against these people."
Lenny :
I saw a deck of yours where you actually represent each of these stages of the lifecycle and the visionary Steve Jobs is the way you represented it, and the pragmatists are just like business people in suits sitting at a conference table.
Geoffrey Moore :

**Exactly. And there's six of them. And the key idea behind that is none of us... By the way, I don't think any of these people are a guru and they don't think I'm a guru. We're using the antelope strategy, it's a herd strategy. But at some point... And by the way, we do this all the time, every one of... Airbnb, I want to get an Airbnb in Portland. Have you ever stayed [inaudible 00**:

33:53]? Is this a good hotel? Is this a good restaurant? Is this a good dentist? Is this a good lawyer? That's how we do it.
Lenny :
I think Uber and Airbnb is the best example of this in action where I would not ride in a random car, especially I think women were most like, "I will never get into a car, into an Uber." This is insane until all of their friends are doing it. And then, "Okay, let's give it a shot."
Geoffrey Moore :
I guess it's okay, yeah.
Lenny :
Yeah. So essentially most people were pragmatists and I guess that makes sense. And pragmatists make up the biggest chunk for it.
Geoffrey Moore :
And by the way, you can be a visionary with some things, a pragmatist with other things, and a conservative with other things. So the way to really think about them is, what is my persona in relation to this decision?
Lenny :
I love this example of the junior high dance problem where nobody wants to go ask the person. It's like, "I'm going to wait for them to come to me. I want to see how this plays out." It's such a good metaphor. In terms of how much of your product needs to be built at each of these stages. What advice do you share? How much do you need for these visionaries versus the next?
Geoffrey Moore :
So with a visionary, you have to have the magic ingredient working. You don't have the whole product. And in fact, your product may be buggy, but it does something... Andy Grove used to call it the 10 x effect. You need to do something that is an order of magnitude better than anything because that's why the visionary is talking to you. They're going, "Oh my gosh, you have this fusion." "Fusion, really?" "Yeah, we got fusion energy." So that's number one. Then what would still cause you to not cross the chasm yet? If there's not enough product there, pragmatists cannot put up with a product that doesn't work. So you may need to do some additional work to say, "Look, we get some more customers. I'm still living hand to mouth. It's mostly project work, but until the product has got enough stability and can be productized, I really can't afford to cross the chasm." So once you have a product that works, then you've got to say, "Okay, now I've got to find a market where it can be the dominant solution." That's the time to cross the chasm.
Lenny :
And a big part of that is obviously they have bosses, they have checklists, they have compliance people, they have IT people, they have people that need to buy into this or this meeting room with six people. They all have to be like, "All right, this is the best choice."
Geoffrey Moore :
And by the way, normally those people are designed to keep you out, and that decision process will take forever and you'll be in the welfare lines before they make their choice. So that's why it's so important to have what we call the compelling reason to buy. You need to have a group of people in a room where the leader, the guy who's going to actually sponsor make this decision is saying, "Look, I already gave this problem to everybody in the room, and our answer sucks." He wouldn't say it that way, but that's the truth. And therefore, we're kind of at the... I mean, I'm getting the message. First of all, my boss's boss's boss knows my name. That's a very bad thing. Secondly, I'm getting the message, you're either going to fix this problem, Geoffrey, or we're going to find somebody who can. So that's what gives them the energy to go against the inertial momentum of the decision-making process in their company.
Lenny :
Let me tell you about a product called arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished on-brand demos in minutes, telling the story of your product is hard, and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why product four teams such as Atlassian, Carta, and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails, and documentation. But don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour our library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a two x higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos.
:
On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before. Creating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale. Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way.

:
So April Dunford was on this podcast and she has this book that she put out recently called Sales Pitch. And she make this point that buying software, SaaS software is harder than selling it these days because you can get fired for buying the wrong thing. It's so stressful. There's all these options. Your boss has to be happy with it. So often people end up just not going with anything. We're just going to keep what we have. It's fine, simpler, safer. Salesforce is fine. And it sounds like that's kind of what you're describing. It's so hard-
Geoffrey Moore :
So if you're a pragmatist, the first thing is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Which makes you totally different than a visionary. A visionary's like, "Yeah, no, come on, break it. Come on, let's move on." It ain't broke, don't fix it. If it is broke, who has fixed it? Is there fix in production? Does the fix work? I want that. In other words, basically to April's point, it is a risk reduction buying strategy. And by the way, you go as slowly as you can normally, but when you're under duress, you have to go faster. So the compelling reason to buy is putting you under duress.
Lenny :
Are there any examples of these compelling reasons to buy that come to mind that give people a sense of here's a really good compelling reason to buy? I don't know if it's a pitch.
Geoffrey Moore :
Well, there's a ton. Well, how about ransomware? I mean, all of a sudden the cybersecurity thing is like holy smoke because it used to be, "Well, they wouldn't attack my company. Or if they did, I mean, I have no assets." Yeah, well, actually... Because it used to be what they did is they would only attack companies that had data that they could resell in the dark web. Then God bless cryptocurrency, people are saying, "Is it cross the chasm yet? Well, their first use case is criminals." It's not a very good use case, I'm sorry to say. But the point is, now ransomware with cryptocurrency can be a monetization, so that means everybody is vulnerable. So that's one kind of compelling reason to buy. But if you look around kids who are struggling with school, the parent has a compelling reason. Anything with healthcare, compelling reason to buy. Anything if you're in a legal problem, you have a compelling risk to buy.
:
So I mean, there's always these situations where you say, "Okay, that's on a personal basis." On a company-wide basis, it may be things like, "Well, what am I supposed to do my office space? Can I get my company to come back to the office or do I have to dump the space? What am I supposed to do? And by the way, I know I'm going to have some kind of space, but do I want to design it the way we used? I'm getting into some space by the way, I got a great deal if it was a fire sale, right? Cool space, what do I put in it? Is it supposed to have offices? Do they have doors, do they not have doors do?" So in other words, there's a bunch of stuff where you get people going, "Okay, how can we help? How can we help?" "I need help. And I've gone to my standard solutions and no, I don't believe that, so I need help."
Lenny :
Okay, so it's interesting that I even misunderstood what you're saying and I think this is a really important point. The compelling reason to buy is not a compelling reason to sell, which people often think about as the pitch you're making. The buy is basically the pain point. They need a really big pain.
Geoffrey Moore :
Yeah, because that's what's going to... So therefore the key to the bowling alley that's different from the tornado, and it's also different from the early market. In the early market it's about you. You tell the story about you and the visionary wants to hear about you. In the tornado it's also about you, because we now have budget to buy this stuff, and you're a candidate. In the bowling alley, it's never about you. And that is so hard for a series of entrepreneurs because they want to give a demo, they want to tell the story, they want to share their vision. The answer is, "We don't care. We don't want to hear your story. We hate demos, and I don't know who you are and I don't care. I'm in trouble. We need to talk about me. We don't want to talk about you."
:
So we have this saying in the Crossing the Chasm playbook. First of all, "Shut the God damn laptop. Just don't open it and start with..." And the way you start the conversation is always the same. "We're here because we've been working with some people in your industry and we understand there's this really serious problem around document management or around Wi-Fi access or whatever it is, and we believe that your company might have it, is that true?" And what's interesting about it is you'll get one of two responses either, "Oh, are you kidding me? Okay, we have that." Or often they'll say, "Well, not exactly." And you go, "Oh," but then before you can say anything else they'll say, "What our real problem is..." So people will talk about their... They want therapy, they'll talk about their problems. So if you're willing to... But as an entrepreneur, you got to realize the gold at this point is problem domain knowledge. That's the thing you really want to collect.
Lenny :
Amazing. So you've sort of answered this question, but I want to make it even more complete. You have this amazing LinkedIn post of these four go-to-market playbooks based on the stage you're in. And you've touched on this already, but it might be helpful just to go through it one by one. And even more helpful would be like, what does it look like when you're in the early market? How do you know if you're in the early market versus in the bowling alley versus in the tornado?
Geoffrey Moore :
Okay, so in the early market, you know you're there because first of all, the story is the technology, and it's specifically the disruptive technology. By the way, you could start a business with a non-disruptive thing, but then you don't need these playbooks, then you're on Main Street. So the assumption is you've got something that nobody's ever done before or seen before. So in that playbook, the first thing is just you hear the responsibilities. And a venture capitalist would say the same thing to you. "Do you have a technology expert who's a wizard? Because we're not going to fund just any two guys and a PowerPoint tech, even though we like your dog."
:

**So that's number one. Number two, "Can you demo the technology?" You have to be able to demo thing. And then three, "Can you create a vision which says what forces are going to release?" And the concept that we use in venture, I call it trapped value. And with the idea is where's the trap value that this innovation would release? Because when you release trapped value, the world will give you a portion of the gain, typically 10%. It's easy an number to do math with. As I said, I'm an English major. So if you want a billion-dollar company, you better find $10 billion worth of trapped value that your technology could- [inaudible 00**:

45:30]
Lenny :
Airbnb is an amazing example of that, right? Where they unlocked people's homes, basically 10%-
Geoffrey Moore :
Yeah. Uber unlocked their backseat of the car. By the way, the free labor force, it was like, "Whoa." Okay, so really cool idea early market fund. For the bowling alley one then the playbook is, "No, where's the problem?" And then you got to take it down to in what geography, what industry, what profession, what use case. And that takes... That's not just... I mean, you want to spend some time in doing that. And then what you want to really do is just maintain intellectual curiosity about the problem as opposed to jumping to the solution. So why is this a hard problem to do? What is going on? Where is the trapped value? By the way, how expensive? What is the cost of not solving this problem?
:
Often it's a risk exposure, or it could be just a gating item on your growth or potentially a churn problem. By the way, if you wanted to pick a compelling reason to buy, how about if you help SaaS companies deal with churn? Do you think they would care about that? I think they might. So the point being... And you're going to say, "Okay, I'm going to learn more about churn and I'm going to really understand... And by the way, I'm going to understand your churn," which is different maybe from somebody else's churn. So it's the problem domain thing. And then you build your go-to market around... The lead gen is, "Hey, do you have any of these seven symptoms of fatal churn?" And the people that respond to that ad are pre-qualified. And then the BDR, if you're at Salesforce, a BDR would call you and say, "Just confirming you have these problems." "Oh yeah, RBI." "And your role at the company is... And are you responsible for doing this?" "Well, actually no, it's Harry, not Mary." "Maybe we should talk to Harry." "Yeah, you probably should talk to Harry."
:
Then you call Harry and you get the appointment with Harry because Harry's got the problem. And then the next thing is you do a diagnostic with them. "So we understand we're talking to your colleagues, here's the problem, here's what we think we're doing. But before we tell you about how great our solution is, let's make sure that we understand what your challenges are." And your goal in that call is to get them to talk as much as possible and for you to take notes. And by the way, this is a place where you probably still want to remember to use a pen because you actually want them to see you writing down their words, because that means, "Okay, he's listening. He's listening."
Lenny :
Oh, interesting. That's a good tip. Like on Zoom, would your advice there be just make sure the camera shows your hands?
Geoffrey Moore :
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Lenny :
Okay. Lean in. Yeah, yeah.
Geoffrey Moore :
Or sometimes... I mean, no, you couldn't do this. I was going to say we record it, but they don't want to record it because they're going to say some things during the call that they won't be necessarily complimentary to all their colleagues and they don't want you to record it.
Lenny :
Got it. So in this bowling alley phase, how do you know you... I know it's not like this binary switch, but that you're ready to move into that versus the early market playbook.
Geoffrey Moore :
Well, I think you get to a point where you realize, "I can't scale my business doing what I've been doing. I mean, I just can't." And if you've taken venture capital, the thing you want to do is, "I don't want to have to raise another..." Well, so understand how venture capital funding works for a second. This is important. A venture capitalist gives you money, and what they're buying from you with this money is, "I want you to use this money to change the state of your company such that when we raise the next round, the next investor will value your company two to three times higher than we're valuing it today."
:
So basically the purpose of this money is to change the value state of your company. If you do anything else with that money, you could have done brilliant things, created amazing demos, hired great people, but if at the end of the day you haven't changed the value state of the company and we have to raise more money, we're going to raise it at the old valuation and I as an investor lose, or even worse, we have a down round and I lose even more.
:
So once you start thinking about that, so we're then Crossing the Chasm. The Crossing the Chasm play is I need to change the state of my company from a cool possibility to what accountants call a going concern. So what is a going concern? A going concern is a company that two years from now you would expect still to be in existence. Why would you do that? Because they have a customer base that's loyal and they have a ecosystem of partners that bring them into new deals and they have established their CAC and LTV, and they've kind of figured out their operating model. And it's not the biggest company in the world.
:
It's somewhere we're now probably in the 10, $20 million, but it's a real company. It's a real company. And that's who you're trying to create when you cross the chasm. And you know you've crossed the chasm when you say, "I don't have to raise any more venture capital. Now, I may want to because I have ambitions to be globally dominant." But you get to raise it on your nickel and on your timeline, not on, "Oh my God, I'm running out of money." So the sooner you can get off with the, "I'm running out..." And particularly last year was fatal to a huge number of companies because that was not how they were thinking about raising funds. They always thought, "Well, there'll be another round, another round, another round." And they were not thinking about changing their valuation state and they're not here.
Lenny :
That's a really interesting insight. This idea that you know you've crossed the chasm if you can survive without more venture funding, how do you think about that, the profit element of that? Because it feels like that's the core to being able to survive without venture funding. Is it about making enough money that you can cut and make a profit, or is there some other reason?
Geoffrey Moore :
All you really care about is cashflow positive. I just want to be able to keep doing what I'm doing. So you don't care about the actual GAAP accounting at all.
Lenny :
I see. So you could cut back and you can get to profitability if you need, but the idea is your cashflow positive?
Geoffrey Moore :
And you'd like to grow and you might want to raise money. But the point is, if you do go out to raise money, you get to raise money at a different valuation. So the way in which venture capitalists categorize you is they say, "What risk is my money going to take off the table?" So an angel investor says, "Well, my money is going to take off the table, the risk of whether you can even create anything, I'm going to give you enough money to get into trouble." That's basically it. And then the Crossing the Chasm money says, "I'm going to take company existence viability off the table. I don't know if you're going to grow, I don't know if you're going to become a venture return, but I'm going to take you going out of business off the table."
:
And then the bowling alley stuff is, "Okay, now I'm buying probably a journey from 10 million to a hundred million dollars," something like that. "And I'm expecting a growth rate," and this is probably where the rule of 40 starts to kick in. If you're playing the rule of 40, we want to raise more money later on, you're going to have a different valuation than we had before. And then the tornado thing by that point, now you say, "You're in Gen AI? You have a large language module? Whoa, okay. You're worth a lot more than we thought," because now the category's in the tornado and that's a different game.
Lenny :
Yeah. I was going to say AI is clearly an example of being in tornado. So maybe just talk a little bit about what that is, the tornado phase and then there's the Main Street playbook.
Geoffrey Moore :
So how do you know the difference between the bowling alley and the tornado? Prior to the tornado, when your sales team calls on the customer, they do not have a budget for you. In the early market, there's no budget for anything. In the bowling alley there's budget, but it's budget for a solution that's not you. It's for the old way of trying to bandaid the problem. So we say in the early market, you have to create budget. In the bowling alley, you have to redirect budget, but that takes sales cycles. It takes time. And if it's a small market... This is why entrepreneurs can win these market segments, because if you're a big established company, this is just a pain in the ass. It's too small a market, it's too much work, it's too hard. Redirecting the... I want my salespeople to go where the budget's already established.
:
Well, when does budget get established? When a category goes horizontal and people go, "Well, yeah, we all want Wi-Fi, we all want mobile apps, we all want cloud computing, we all want whatever it is." And now what happens is... And by the way the pragmatist heard is they went from, "You're not doing that, are you?" "No, me neither." "Okay, good." To, "You are, you are, you are. Oh, we're behind. We better do it." So these budgets come into the market and kind of all at the same time, which is what creates the tornado. Because if you give a department a budget, they will spend it and when they spend it, they're going to spend it with a vendor and whoever vendor they select they're probably going to stay with. So now the market share battle is now on, and whoever gets the most customers early on, the ecosystem starts to form around them.
:

**So in the nineties, we saw a lot of tornado, gorilla play. Cisco, Intel, Oracle, obviously Microsoft. I mean these companies, [inaudible 00**:

55:36], they were all incredibly competitive companies. They were all tornado plays. Between client server and the internet, it just created this massive tornado effect. And that game plan is very competitive sales to grab market share. And then at some point, if you're not number one, then you have to kind of do a defensive maneuver and retreat into a niche and say, "Okay, if I can't be a gorilla, I at least need to be a chimp." And a chimp is like a local gorilla. "I'm not the gorilla, but..." "I'm not Cisco, I'm Juniper." But for telcos, Juniper was the Cisco of telcos at that time. So anyway, I don't know if you saw in the paper today, but at the other end of that lifecycle, HPE has bought Juniper.
Lenny :

**[inaudible 00**:

56:28] is happening. I like that. That's good news. So one of the most interesting lessons you teach is also that these playbooks don't work together well. Basically if you use one in the wrong phase, it's the opposite. It has the opposite effect. So before we get there, let me just summarize maybe quickly the playbook in each of these four. I have some notes here and then maybe just talk about why is it that they fail if you pick the wrong one. So in the early market, you're looking for a visionary customer that just wants to use something new and cool and stay ahead of the curve. In the bowling alley phase, you want to engage with a pragmatic business person who has a huge problem and they need a fix and you're there for them. In the tornado, there's just this land grab, something is just going crazy, AI and everyone's just spend, spend, I need AI in my product. And then Main Street is just, it's kind of the sustaining tech that everyone just needs to make sure continues working and doesn't deteriorate.
Geoffrey Moore :

**By the way, the way I would [inaudible 00**:

57:25] the last two is think of tornado as kind of the land and Main Street as the expand. I mean, that's not a bad way to think about the two as well. Yeah, you got it. You got it.
Lenny :
Okay, great. So why is it that these undercut each other if you're trying to use either the one in the wrong phase or use both?
Geoffrey Moore :
Well, so let's start with classic sales 101 from the nineties. Qualify the customer on budget before you make a sales call. That absolutely is critical on Main Street. I mean it's critical on the tornado, it's dumb on Main Street because obviously they have budget, they've got budgets that even has your name on it if you can go get it. But it's a big mistake in the early market or in the bowling alley because they don't have budget. So you're not going to get it. And the way you win in the early market is with a project model and the way you win in the bowling alley is with a solution model.
:
And the problem is if you bring a project model to the bowling alley, the problem is you won't scale because it won't be repeatable. The ecosystem won't form around you. And if you bring a solution model to the early market, it's like you're over investing in one thing. The visionary's saying, "Well, yeah, but I have so many other things I want to do." So they're going to want to take you way off your solution roadmap. So each one of these things, the market dynamics call for a very clear response. It's not hard to see the response. What people struggle with is, I have been successful with this playbook, the market has moved to the next phase, but I'm really good at the old playbook, so I want to stay with the playbook I'm good at. So that's when they get in trouble.
Lenny :
So I think that's extra reason to pay close attention to which phase you're in and that you're practicing the correct playbook. We've talked about AI a little bit, and I don't want to get too far down this road, but I guess is there any advice you would share for an AI startup in being in this tornado or a company looking to integrate AI? Is there anything that you've seen of just make sure you're doing this right?
Geoffrey Moore :
Well, it's interesting about... And particularly right now, I mean the thing that's caught everybody's imagination is generative AI. So we should be thinking about things like open AI with Microsoft and Co-pilot and those kinds of things. Well, maybe not. It depends on what... So from a customer's point of view, there's AI in the early market, there's AI in the bowling alley, there's AI in the chasm, there's AI in the tornado, and there's AI on Main Street. So I mean, I would argue if you go to Microsoft Copilot, you're on Main Street, you're not taking any risk, you're experimenting with a new thing. It's kind of cool, makes you more productive. God bless. It's kind of like just an add-on to Teams or to your whole Office 365 suite. Stuff that's in the tornado right now, I don't know. I'm trying to think about what is the use case for Gen AI? I'm not sure there is one in the tornado, but the closest I would say is Salesforce is probably close enough.
:
They have a sales co-pilot. They have a services copilot, right? I'm sure there marketing co-pilot. So you're going, but we're going to change our sales motion and we're going to use generative AI in line, in our performance on a very widespread, across our entire base. So all our salespeople are going to use this new tool. That would be okay. And that makes sense because the new tool... First of all, Salesforce has their own large language module. So it's not like you're going out to the open AI world and having all those issues. So you can do it and there's a very high productivity return at a modest risk, I think, and modest disruption. For the bowling alley you'd say, I don't know if this is bowling alley or early market, I'll say it's bowling alley.
:
So if you're Sal Khan and you have the Khan Academy and you're saying, "Look, we want to provide educational resources for the world for young people." The problem with education right now is that particularly after the pandemic, you're a teacher you used to have... When you were a teacher in say K through 12, K through eight, you have a class of 30 kids and probably 10 to 15 of them are middle of the road and some number are actually significantly ahead and some number are behind. And your job as a teacher is to kind of work with that. Well, after the pandemic, you might have five different grade levels in the same classroom, not three or six even. That's an impossible problem. But if you said, "Look, we can use Gen AI tutoring and we can tune it to each one of those sixth grade levels."
:
Now that's a teacher co-pilot, but that's a really specialized idea. So you go, "Well, that's amazing." And then if you wanted to go to the other side, "You say all these ad agencies say they do this really cool advertising, but I think I can do it myself with Gen AI and I'm going to sell it to other people." I mean, you can imagine a whole businesses that say we write legal opinions and we always start with Gen AI. We don't ship Gen AI, there's a human in the loop. We're going to do amazing or more images, maybe. We're going to design visual images with all the really cool stuff you could do. We're going to invent a new agency or a new kind of agency we're going to charge to..." I don't know what it would be, but the point is Gen AI I think can be absorbed by the marketplace at multiple places.
Lenny :
As you were talking about that lawyer example, I was thinking part of the pitch would be... And it's also a lot cheaper, but that reminds me of this other post that you wrote, The Seven Deadly Sins of Crossing the Chasm. And I wanted to chat about some of these, and one of them is discounting before you cross the chasm. Can you talk about why that's something you want to avoid?
Geoffrey Moore :
Back to that issue about, "Heart surgery 9.99, this Saturday only bring a coupon." I mean, the discounting model makes sense when something's commoditized or the let's even do the freemium model. The freemium model makes sense if there is no risk in adopting the offer. But chasms are based on risk bearing decisions. Basically that's the problem that creates the chasm. I have to make a risk bearing buying decision. So discounting does not reduce risk. In fact, it might even increase risk because this vendor might say, "Well, yeah, I'll give you a better price, but now I'm not going to give you the extra support or we'll have a change of scope." We'll say, "Yes, but now, that wasn't in the contract. So you have to add more." And all of that is fair game on Main Street, but it's not for crossing the chasm.
Lenny :
I'm going to pick on a couple of these other sims that you mentioned. One is you call the target customer mix up. Can you talk about that?
Geoffrey Moore :
The key to this whole Crossing the Chasm playbook is start with the world. Don't start with... Well, the question we're trying to answer is where is a small pool of trapped value that we can become our pool? So that's why we have geography, profession, use case. We're just trying to get big enough to matter, but small enough to lead is one. And then once you find that pool, the question you have to say is, "Who controls access to that? Who's going to sponsor my deal in order for me to solve that, to release that trapped value for that company?" That's your target customer. And you may not know them. Typically, my experience is you probably have worked with at least one company in the industry at some point along the line. It's kind of odd if you just had never heard of the industry and you picked that one.
:
Usually that's why I said, "Well, maybe I should have added that to how do you know you're ready to cross the chasm?" You should at least have a hunch. You should at least, "We've done this work, and I think this is the one." Now, you still have to go validate it and make it happen. But basically the way you would validate it is rather than try to go to a research or do something, that won't work. You say, "Well, we're going to run a marketing campaign, a modest one. I'm going to see if I can't get two more of the same use case. I'm willing to bet the next three months of my company by saying in this three months, all we're going to do is try to get two more deals that have this pattern." And that would be kind of the way you might go after it.
Lenny :
So I think this is worth spending a little more time on this idea of how you know you're ready to cross the chasm. So one is you find one very excited marquee customer, then you're sharing, maybe find a couple more and see if it's actually starting to roll and tip.
Geoffrey Moore :
No. Well, I said it wrong. So the marquee customer is probably not in your beachhead market. The marquee customer is a famous company that you have the visionary sponsor. That's the thing, because that's the company that the business press wanted to write about, or the tech press wanted to write about. People went, "Oh, you were the guys who..." You're like Hans Solo. You did whatever that run was in 15 parsecs. I can't even remember what it was. But that's your claim to fame. It's your claim to fame. But the Crossing the Chasm one is, "Oh..." And by the way the press is not interested in the crossing chasm, but the local, if there was a local press, they'd be all over it.
Lenny :
The Kessel Run.
Geoffrey Moore :
The Kessel Run. Thank you. The Kessel Run in 15 parsecs. Thank you.
Lenny :
That's right.
Geoffrey Moore :
Exactly. That was his visionary thing.
Lenny :
So I think the important takeaway there is there's always this advice of talk to customers, make sure they're happy, build what... Not necessarily build what they want, but make sure you're understanding what they need. But I think when your most important insights here is make sure you're talking to the right people. Which are essentially people in the next stage, essentially of the adoption life cycle. The more pragmatists.
Geoffrey Moore :
Yes. And they have to be the... I think you need to talk to the economic buyer as opposed to the end user, because the end user will be saying, "Oh, yeah, you're right. Oh, it's just terrible and we're oppressed." But if their boss doesn't want to sponsor it, it doesn't work.
Lenny :
Which is hard, hard often when you're building B2B software, you just don't make it great. And then it's like, "Oh, these people don't actually care what they're buying it. They just have all these check boxes." And then another deadly sin, which you've touched on, but I think it might be worth sharing again, is just this idea, you call it the compelling reason, confusion, where instead of thinking about your compelling reason to sell, you think about what is the pain point you're solving, compelling reason to buy.
Geoffrey Moore :
Obviously as an entrepreneur, you have a compelling reason to sell. But what they tend to do is in trying to cross the chasm, if they're not using this approach, they think, "Well, I haven't made my product attractive enough." So then they'd say, "Well, I'm going to make a sexier demo, or I'm going to change my deck. I'm going to write a new..." And the sales guy comes back, says, "I had a great presentation. This is the deck that we ought to be using." And that's all about compelling ways to sell, not compelling reasons to buy. And the pragmatist, by the way... And by the way, the practice will take the meeting. One of the problems with the chasm is they don't say no. They just never say yes. And they actually encourage you... "You should come back again with this too. This is really interesting." Yeah, it is really interesting.
Lenny :
Kind of along those lines, positioning, how important is that, and any advice on figuring out your positioning when you're doing this? I know you talk a lot about making sure you focus on their pain point, but at some point you're like, "Here's what we're doing for you."
Geoffrey Moore :
One of the nice things about Crossing the Chasm is the positioning formula is absolutely the same every time. It's really cool. So basically when you're thinking about positioning, you're saying, "Look, I'm going with this use case in this particular segment." So they have an incumbent vendor. The advantage of the incumbent vendor is they understand the business, but they don't have the new technology. Conversely, you have technology competitors who have as good technology, maybe a better technology than you have, but they're not committed to this domain expertise of this thing.
:
So your positioning is, "We are the technology leaders who have specialized and committed to solve this problem. And by the way, we have huge respect for your incumbent vendor. We're not asking you to kick them out. They just can't solve this problem. We also have respect for our peers, but frankly, they wouldn't know your problem if they wouldn't recognize it in a lineup. We are here, and by the way, if anybody comes into our quadrant, we're going to kick their ass. We are going to be beyond compare. Nobody is going to handle this problem with this kind of technology the way we will, and that's our claim of fame. That's what we're going to do, and that's our positioning."
Lenny :
I love that. Say you're building a product led growth company, a bottom up oriented B2B SaaS company. Is there anything that changes in your advice?
Geoffrey Moore :
Yeah, if you're going to use a volume ups approach like Atlassian or anything grows up from the bottom up, you're playing a different game. First of all, you're playing... Because you attract the end user before you attract the economic buyer. So you have some version of a freemium strategy, that's what you're going to do. And Yammer did this, right? And eventually got bought by Microsoft. So the way you play that game is, first of all, you probably do need some funding, not necessarily, maybe you can do this all on AWS and a credit card. But the game that is going to be, how do I create that moment of criticality? What you would do is you'd say... First of all, you need telemetry. So you need to figure out what are the people really doing with our product? And then you need to find a way to communicate with them to see if you can ferret out, is there a compelling reason to buy thing in their environment? So it'd be a different way of doing early market.
:
You would not have a marquee client, but to cross the chasm... You cannot cross the chasm of product-led growth, you can't because it is like saying, "Well, yeah, I'm going to cure Covid by just putting vaccines out in public places." It's like, "No, people need to learn more. No." So you'd have to do that. Where product-led growth plays really interestingly, is in the land and expand phases of the market. If you can land with a hot product, but more importantly, product-led growth, which is really good at is expand because it prompts the user to get more involved. And that's classically a Main Street play. But there's got to be no risk. That product-led growth works when basically the extended the next purchase has very low risk, and therefore you're not really dealing with chasms.
Lenny :
That is incredibly interesting. Interestingly, every product led growth company ends up building a sales team, 100% of them, including Atlassian, which had product led growth for a long time. And I don't know if anyone's heard this perspective on it, that if you really want to cross the gap... I imagine it happens in some form of-
Geoffrey Moore :
Well, and here's the thing. The reason they build a sales team eventually is they need to get enterprise deals. And obviously you need a sales team to get enterprise deals. And one of the mistakes you could make is hiring an enterprise salesperson when you're trying to cross the chasm. Enterprise salespeople are not good chasm crossers because they're used to doing horizontal coverage model. This is like no, domain expert narrow model. You want somebody that looks more like a sales engineer than a salesperson. You want somebody very diagnostic, very committed to the integrity of the problem solution framework. So it's just different.
Lenny :
Okay. Just a couple more questions. You had this very public exchange with Martin Casado, he's a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. And just to summarize briefly, essentially he was arguing that I think some people believe once you've crossed the chasm, life's good. It's all downhill. People are going to start pulling your product out of you. It's going to be so easy. And his argument is he doesn't see that, it's endless pain and suffering and hardships. And I know you went back and forth trying to correct this, but what's a way to think about what happens?
Geoffrey Moore :
So actually, Martin and I had a couple of this... By the way, his biggest point... I'll come back to your point in a second, but his biggest point is, "Jeff..." The venture community at least, and certainly Andreessen Horowitz doesn't deal with the level of granularity of Crossing the Chasm anymore. There's too much money that wants to be put to work. By the way, there's so much software already out there that the notion that your software is going to be that disruptive is increasingly improbable because you're not standing on the shoulders of giants, you're standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of giants. So he was making a bunch of those points, which I thought were pretty interesting. But his other point about, does life ever become easy? No, life never becomes easy. The problems change.
:
The challenge with software is... Well, there's a lot of challenges with it, but software that people use, the application software, we all have different minds. We all have different contexts. To make a product that would work, that would solve what I want and solve what you want and solve what the listener wants. I mean, the margin, no. We're going to have different expectations. So there's always... And then of course there's competition, and then there's funding, and then there's technological shifts, and just about the time it really works well, they say, "No, we got to put it... No, no, no. You put it in the data center. We got to put it in the cloud." "Oh, no, no, you got in the cloud, you got to put it in Kubernetes." "Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand. It's edge AI, it's not cloud." It just goes on and on and on. So I think if you're going to play this game, you got to be up for... Yeah, there's going to be a new headache every week.
Lenny :
That's exactly how I see it. I always tell founders, you shouldn't start a company unless you can't not start a company.
Geoffrey Moore :

**Yes. By the way, why did I leave? [inaudible 01**:

16:28] County was a great place to be, but I had to do my own thing.
Lenny :
And that's a real pull. Kind of along the lines of something you just shared, maybe a final question. Is there something you've changed your mind about or something you've evolved your thinking on recently? Either from the beginning of the book or just even more recent?
Geoffrey Moore :
I think what I realized over time increasingly was this is a model that's really optimized for B2B markets, because it implies federated decision making around high risk buying decisions. I would say for the 20th century, that was 95% of tech. But what was so interesting about the change in the century... Because remember right at the change of the century, B2B tech went in the tank, the tech bubble just... Because everybody was afraid of the Y2K problem. So they did a whole bunch of buying up of software, and then there was a year where they think, "Well, we ate more than we could at Thanksgiving dinner. We're not interested in eating another burger here. "So the market went in the tank. By the way at that point, venture started saying, "Well, maybe we should be investing in biotech, or maybe we should doing clean tech." Venture stepped back from the table too.
:
But out of this, consumer computing came out of nowhere. And for my generation, it was unimaginable. The first time I heard about Google and they said, "We're going to save every search argument." I thought, "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. They're not going to be able to afford it." But their model was, "We are rethinking this thing from the ground up. Geoffrey, you have no idea what we're doing." And boy were they right. So the point was when that came in, then consumer computing and then the iPhone hits, and then we have mobile apps. You have a world now where the B2C play can actually be the core of innovation. It used to be B2C was an afterthought. Now it's like, "No, no, no, no, B2B might be the afterthought." So it's completely different... And the whole digital transformation of the universe, and we're still living through the digital transformation 20 years in, and I don't think Crossing the Chasm is designed for that problem. So that's a different problem.
Lenny :
So basically, if you're building a consumer app, don't spend time studying Crossing the Chasm.
Geoffrey Moore :
Yeah, if you're doing B2B, this is the most reliable playbook. It's still on... People are still into this playbook 30 years in. So it's obviously... The playbook kind of works.
Lenny :
I said this earlier, I feel like people are just reinventing many of the things you uncovered 30 years ago. Everyone's like, "Oh yeah, target audience, really important, or finding a marque customer." So I'm really happy that we spent this time digging into many of your theories.
Geoffrey Moore :
Well, Lenny, thank you for being... You've been a really great prompter and questioner, so thank you very, very much.
Lenny :
I really, really appreciate that. Is there anything you want to leave listeners with as a final thought or piece of advice or just anything?
Geoffrey Moore :
Look, I don't know if anybody's reading the paper recently, but the world's not exactly nailing it right now. There's a lot of stuff going on that we could do a lot better, and software enabled technology is almost certainly at the core of any solution that scales to any world problem that matters. I think it's more important to be an entrepreneur now than maybe ever. I wouldn't make becoming a billionaire my goal. Frankly, I don't even know what a billionaire would even do with their money. I don't even how to even imagine their money. That's a thousand million dollars. It doesn't make any sense, but what does make sense? But what does make sense is to... I'm happy to get two... Do I know what to do with 10 million? Yeah. Could I do 20? Probably. Could I use a hundred? Probably not. But at some point, I want people to make yourself a great living, make yourself... But after that, have an impact. If you're gifted enough to be able to start a software company and do something original, you're a scarce resource, so don't waste it.
Lenny :
Amazing. I'm going to sneak it one more question along these same lines actually. Your last book is very unlike all your other books. It's called The Infinite Staircase, which is essentially a guide to living a good life and a meaningful life. Is there maybe one piece of advice you could share with folks of just how to live a better life, a more meaningful life, happier life?
Geoffrey Moore :
The purpose of that book was twofold. One was... So I was looking around... And this is an American sort of experience between social media and the politicians or whatever. Our ability to defend traditional values is becoming increasingly challenging. And historically, you say, "Well, religion was sort of the place where the foundation for solidifying traditional values." But in my lifetime, the counter explanation of how we got here, other than being created by a creator, this whole the Big Bang and the Darwinian model, it's becoming increasingly credible and I'm fascinated by it. So the question I had in the back of my mind is how could you take that model and still support traditional ethics?
:
So the first part was, well, what's the model? It turns out to explain getting from the Big Bang to Lenny and Geoffrey talking on this podcast, there's a lot of steps you've got to go through. But there's a whole thing about complexity and how complexity emerges in layers and the staircase is a series of layers, and the first two thirds of the book takes 11 stairs. That gets you from physics to theory. And it's like, really? Yeah, yeah. From a cloud of atoms to us talking about Crossing the Chasm, 11 steps, we can get you there. It's kind of fun. It's assembling the last 25 years of my reading. It's fascinating stuff. All these different topics, and I was just trying to knit it together. No original research. I was just literally just trying to get the story together.
:
But then the last third was, okay, that's a very reasonable narrative. It's maybe even more reasonable than religious narratives, but now how do you validate ethical action and where does it come from? So the last part was about, okay, how do you do that? How does it derive from that creation story? The secular creation stories were. So that was what was important. At the end of the day, I think the message of that book is just, you really do need to do good, but it's not because you're obeying... In this framework, it's not because you're a bang a divine creator. It's because we're mammals and mammals nurture their young, and we were gifted with unconditional love when we were born because otherwise, you and I could not be here. I mean, a 1-year-old cannot... If somebody doesn't love the hell out of a 1-year-old, they're not going to be two. So we know where we started. So come on, those values were built into us. They don't have to come from above. They can come from below, and therefore, how can you integrate them into your life? And that was where the book... Anyway.
Lenny :

**That is a beautiful message to end on. I promised I'd get you out of here in one minute. Just to let people know, you do speaking, you do consulting, where can people find you online if they want to reach out and- [inaudible 01**:
