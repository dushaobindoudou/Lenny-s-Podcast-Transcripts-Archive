40:54]. Talk about a platform that pays for itself. But I'm perhaps most excited about Sprigg's newest launch, which extends the power of the platform pre-launch and makes it possible to test mockups and prototypes with your own users in minutes.

But before we get to that, I wanted to have one follow-up question. What are some classic examples of high leverage tasks that PM should try to do more often and think about? What's in that bucket, generally? Even though you pointed out a lot of times they could be in any of the buckets, depending on how you execute them. Are there things that are just like, you should probably spend a lot of your time doing X, Y, Z?
Shreyas Doshi :
Yeah. So, turns out that the L tasks, PMs implicitly just deep down they know what their L tasks are, because those are the tasks that are bothering them the most because they are not doing them or because they're not doing them as well as they know they should. So, the classic example of this is the case where a PM will say, "I know I need to work on getting our strategy right, but I don't have time because I'm busy firefighting. I'm busy just dealing with all these execution issues. And I just don't have time to work on the strategy piece." Sometimes we console ourselves by saying, "Yeah. That's because we have all these things going on this month, but trust me, next month, we're going to have ample time and I'm going to just spend a whole week working on strategy." Well, the next month rolls around and it's the same thing, you've got other issues.
:
The reason we procrastinate on these tasks are, one, because we know that they're L tasks, we know the impact they'll have, and we are a little scared. That's one. The second is they require dedicated attention. And again, we are afraid about whether we'll have anything interesting to say. That's the deep fear. Why many people procrastinate on strategy? Because deep down, they don't know if they can formulate a good strategy. So time becomes a convenient excuse for us where we say, "Well, it's not me. It's just, I don't have time to work on it." And by the way, everything I say here, I have been that person. So I have been that person who's procrastinated on an L task, whether it's the strategy or whether it's writing the PRD for this really difficult feature, or it is working on aligning two teams where that alignment would create a lot of impact, but it's hard, it's an L task, but I don't do it because I don't want to deal with this other person, this manager I love to collaborate with to make it happen.
:
And perhaps, I don't know if we'll get along. I don't know if I can have that tough conversation. And so again, it's an L task, but I'll try to apply bandaids instead of just tackling it head on. So, this is tough stuff. And what I've found useful there is two things, two tactics make a huge difference in helping us target L tasks better. One is the idea of placebo productivity. So, what I do is before I have to tackle an L task, that couple of days leading up to it, I do all these placebo productivity tasks. Basically, I intentionally do N tasks and O tasks. I fill up my day with N and O tasks.
:
And I keep reminding myself, "Yeah, you're just doing neutral and overhead tasks." Because then that just tricks me into thinking, "Okay, if I've been doing this placebo productivity task for the last two days, now, it's the right time for me to do this L task." So that's one tactic. The other is change of location. Nothing, for me, at least fights my procrastination for L tasks better than changing the place from which I'm working. So if I normally work from this desk, the appointed day I did my couple of days of placebo productivity tasks, and on that appointed day, when I'm slated to do an L task, I will actually go out and work from somewhere else, whether it's a coffee shop or a co-working space or some other space. And I find that change of place just forces a focus and a shift in mindset that helps me bang out that L task very quickly and do it really well.
Lenny :
That are some great advice. There's so many layers of advice in that answer. Your point about the high leverage tasks being the task that you know you should do, but don't want to do, makes me think of a quote that I always come back to that the cave you fear contains the treasure that you seek. And I often find that to be true. And it's this reminder to just wherever the compass is pointing where it's most difficult, it's probably where the biggest opportunity lies. And so, that's a really good reminder of all that.
Shreyas Doshi :
So wise. Yeah, pay attention to your fears because they're telling you something.
Lenny :
Speaking of fears, our third big idea is around the three levels of product work. Basically the three things that a PM should be focused on and how often when you're not aligned on what is most important to you and your team, it often leads to conflict. And so, I'm excited for you to unpack this idea of these three levels of product. We can all share what they are impact, execution and optics. And when I saw this for the first time, I always come back to these three things, because it's so simple and so accurate. And so, I'm excited for you to unpack all this.
Shreyas Doshi :
This idea that there are three levels of product work, impact, execution, and optics. Once you understand it, it explains a lot of what you see on product teams and organizations in general. And so, perhaps start with an example that most product people, product leaders and founders are used to seeing, and something I've seen dozens of times in my career that there's a product review, say, where you as a PM are presenting to the CEO. And as you're presenting what the plan is, obviously since this is a real world product, there's going to be some compromises that you're taking. And so, the CEO perhaps asks about, "Okay, well, why is our customer service response time going to be so high in this case?" And you've thought about it, it's like you did not think about that issue, but that is a good reason why. You talk to the VP of customer support and they don't have the funding this quarter to support your product fully, which will then result in a poor customer service experience for this kind of new product that you're launching.
:
But then you've agreed. You've used your skills of influence to agree that, okay, next quarter, they're going to allocate a lot more people to your product so that the customer service experience will get better next quarter. And so, the CEO asks, "Why is the customer service experience going to be poor here? Or they make a remark like that." And then you reply with all these good reasons. Again, good reasons. And needless to say the rest of the product review doesn't go as well. And after the product review, you wonder what happened. Maybe you ask your manager what happened and particularly you're wondering why couldn't the CEO see a very rational argument about why you can't do this at launch.
Lenny :
Never happened to me. Never happened.
Shreyas Doshi :
And so, it's like, why doesn't he or she see that? And the reason is that you are thinking at different levels. So you as a PM perhaps are fixated as you are dealing with this launch or this project, you are fixated on the execution level, which is what does it take to get something done? And how can I do it? How can I hit the next milestone? Those are all the things we tend to think about when we are thinking at the execution level. The CEO on the other hand is approaching it from the impact level. And particularly perhaps in this case, what is the impact to the customer experience? And often CEOs are the ones, or founders are the ones that are thinking about, what is the impact to our brand? And so the CEO is thinking at the impact level, you're thinking at the execution level, there is that mismatch.
:
We litigate the minutiae of whatever issue we are discussing, but we never really recognize that it's because we are default thinking at different levels. And so, this realization helped me better understand why there were conflicts between two very smart and well intentioned people or groups within a company. I was myself guilty of this as well earlier on in my career, time and again, I noticed that we can, again, keep litigating the specific issue without understanding that, "Oh no, there's actually just a fundamental mismatch." And it's not like people are stuck at one level and can never think at a different level, it's just that we tend to default to certain levels, and that's like sometimes our preferred level. We can switch levels, but that requires a nudge sometimes. And so, that observation helped explain a lot of things, including what kind of people an organization will promote? Does it promote people who default operate at the impact level? Does it promote people more who default operate at the execution level or at the optics level? So, it has very wide ranging impacts on just overall how an organization functions.
Lenny :
What's an example of optics? And when optics matters, when you might not be thinking about the importance of that? Just impacting that one a little bit.
Shreyas Doshi :
Yes. So, optics is about creating awareness of the impact and the execution that you're doing or your team is doing. That is the most compact definition I can come up with for optics. And optics is a good thing. So I'm not saying don't think about optics whatsoever, I think it's actually important to think about optics. And now I'm talking about just internal optics. External optics is an entirely different thing and that's like marketing PR and that's definitely highly important. But even when we talk about simply we limit scope to internal optics, I'll make the observation that you should be spending some time on internal optics because it creates energy, it creates awareness, it creates excitement, it creates opportunities for feedback. Those are all really great things and they will enable greater impact and better execution for you.
:
The challenge with optics is that in certain organizations that balance gets thrown off, where optics sometimes becomes the goal where somehow implicitly the organization or its culture has indicated to it's people that as long as you do the optics well, you are going to be fine, you are going to be appreciated here, you're going to be rewarded here as long as you do the optics fine.
:
And it's not like the organization woke up in the morning and said, 'This is the culture we want to create." It just happens again through little actions that occur every day, it happens through who you hire, who you fire, who you promote and what kinds of things do you appreciate at all hands as the CEO or the founder. Do you appreciate a launch? Do you appreciate results? Do you appreciate, I don't know, an awesome status update that somebody sent? So a status update doesn't on its own accomplish anything. I mean, they are important, but a status update is an optics activity. Now, it is a necessary optics activity, but if you start appreciating the necessary optics activities, constantly, the signal you are sending to people is, 'Oh, you got to focus on this optics activity." So then, that becomes the goal and that can be really harmful.
Lenny :
So there's these three levels of product work. Do you have advice for, should I just default to one of these normally based on just as a PM, I should always be thinking about impact or is it more, just make sure you're aligned with your leader with your team? Is that the more important takeaway?
Shreyas Doshi :
Yes. I think that's the more important takeaway is again, it's about now we have a vocabulary that we can talk about in an objective manner without pointing fingers. It's like, 'Oh, you tend to be fixated on all these execution details and that's not the right thing." That's the type of feedback sometimes that gets shared. So now you have vocabulary to talk about this and once you have that, you can, as a team, decide what is most important given your context. I'll give you an example. For early stage teams, of course, they need to be thinking about the eventual impact, but what they should actually, I think, most early stage teams should actually optimize for execution. Assuming that they have come up with a reasonable hypothesis about what's going to win, their main emphasis needs to be on execution because you will not see impact readily on a one week horizon or a one month horizon or perhaps even on a quarterly horizon.
:
So that's an example of a situation where let's be explicit, we need to get great at execution. We have a set of core insights that were informed by our desire to make an impact. But now that we are responsible for converting these insights into a product, let's be largely operating at the execution level, as an example. Say there is a platform team and that platform team has had some issues lately with availability that has disrupted some other teams within the company and their products. Perhaps that platform team should have a conversation that, 'You know what, yes, we need to focus on impact obviously to avoid this negative impact, but also let's pay some more attention to optics because we haven't been communicating with teams as much teams that rely on us. So let's create a better communication channel with them. Let's create better status updates for them," and whatnot. So again, the point is not so much like, "Oh, this is the right level and all other levels are wrong," it's about being sensitive to what's right in this situation.
Lenny :
So you talked about execution and how maybe for early stage startups that might be default the most important type of work to be focused on. And that's actually a really good lead way to our fourth big idea, which is a provocative tweet that you put out a while ago that you said, "The most execution problems are actually strategy problems or culture problems." And so, I'm excited to hear a little bit more about how you discovered that and what that means and maybe how to address those problems.
Shreyas Doshi :
And so, I realized this somewhat late in my career as a leader, most execution problems that I encounter in a high performing environment where everybody has the right intentions are actually not execution problems, they are either strategy problems or interpersonal problems or cultural problems. And so, just to illustrate it, I'll make the observation that many leaders are extremely busy in such environments, whether it's a fast growth startup or a fast growth larger company, they're extremely busy, they're usually overwhelmed. Like I said earlier, I was one of those people. Take a deeper look at what they're engaged in. And I got a chance to look at it with my peers that I was mentoring or coaching or people on my team, PMs or PM leaders were extremely busy and usually overwhelmed.
:
I noticed two things, that what made them busy is two things. One is that somehow the organization had imposed very high optics requirements. So they had to do a lot of optics related work, show up at certain status meetings and blah, blah, blah. So we talked about that. So let's leave that aside. But the other reason they're so overwhelmed is that they're constantly solving execution problems. So they solve the most important ones, the new ones come up and they solve those. And then there are two new ones to solve and on and on, it's a classic guacamole. And as I noticed that, and I'll share a concrete example of where this might happen, where an execution, a seemingly execution problem surfaces, so say two teams are misaligned. They need to work together where they're misaligned. Everybody knows it. And that is affecting our execution. That misalignment is affecting our execution. It's affecting our ability to hit our OKRs, it's affecting their ability to hit their OKRs.
:
So as a leader or say, you are a director of product or VP of product responsible for one of these teams, you now charge with fixing this execution problem so we can move faster. So you do a dozen meetings to figure out what's going on, you try to diagnose the issue, how to better align. And then you talk to your peers on the other side, and then you decide, "Okay, here's what we're going to do to solve this execution problem. We are going to create a new review process." And so, we are going to create this process and we are going to review priorities on a regular basis across these two teams. And then we are going to also as the managers of these individual teams to do regular one-on-ones so they can stay in sync. So this type of scenario is extremely common, again, especially in high growth organizations that want to accomplish a lot.
:
You'll come up with this solution after many meetings and a lot of work, a lot of conversation. And so, as I grew as a leader, I got increasingly curious about this type of situation. And when I looked at it more closely, I started realizing that what looked like an execution problem, this misalignment and this causing execution issues wasn't usually an execution problem. Instead, it was a strategy problem in some cases, because the reason we are misaligned is because we are pursuing different strategies or that is more often the cases, the reason we are misaligned is because we don't know what the strategy is. So, we don't know what the strategy is. We craft some OKRs based on what makes sense. The OKRs are not very well aligned. We don't have a sense of priorities, and we also don't have a sense of what we do when reality changes.
:
This is all stuff that a clear correct strategy should help inform. But actually this lack of strategy is what's causing this misalignment, it's not because they're not meeting regularly. And what happens in these meetings is, again, you're arguing the minutiae of like, "Well, are you going to work on this feature? I depend on this. Or can you swap two engineers from this team?" All of this stuff that PMs are very familiar with. You're talking about all the small stuff, but nobody recognizes that like, "Can we fix that?" So, as I started seeing this often was a strategy problem, sometimes it was not a strategy problem, it was a culture problem. So, what is a culture problem in this situation where two teams are misaligned?
:
It's basically that you have a problem where you have set a culture that you are supposed to mainly optimize for your OKRs. In a culture like that, it becomes really hard to allow two teams to work better together because if one of the teams doesn't hit their OKRs, because they were helping rightly for the sake of the company, they were helping this other team that team's manager is going to get his or her wrist lap at the next performance review.
:
So, that is a culture problem. Now, you can set up the meeting and you can request all the syncs you want between these people, it's not going to solve the culture problem, the execution problem is going to manifest in different ways a month down the road. So that's like an example of a culture problem or it could be an interpersonal problem, and this is actually quite common. It's simply that these two people cannot get along. The two team managers do not get along and they just constantly might be creating friction. And so, as a leader, it is important for you to spot that and then coach them through their differences, coach one or both of them through that so that they can better work together. When you solve that, you won't need that monthly review meeting and all these things and 50 other things, because they're not going to work anyway. So that's just one concrete example of team misalignment, which is often viewed as an execution problem, but is not an execution problem.
Lenny :
Are there signs that tell you where dates are slipping, people are surprised? Of execution problems that you have, are there signs that maybe it's one of these other factors? Or is your experience like it's almost always one of these other things?
Shreyas Doshi :
So there are some problems that are truly execution problems. So, an example of that is say you have infrastructure issues, your infrastructure is just old and it can no longer sustain all the usage that you're getting, that will cause execution problems where you'll move slower or you will have outages or high latencies or whatever the case is. That's an execution problem. Another such example of what is really an execution problem is you have a skills' gap. You have say engineers who are not particularly skilled in a certain technology or a certain type of scale that happen to be working in that area, well that is going to create execution issues or you have a PM who is more of a zero to one person, but now you made them responsible for this scale mature initiative, so that's a skill gap and that can cause execution problems.
:
So, there are very concrete instances where there is a real execution problem. It's just that in high performing organizations that are growing really fast, we ignore the other factors that might be at play. And so, now what tells me if something is seemingly an execution problem but not actually an execution problem, a sure far way of identifying those is when you put on a bandaid and the bandaid falls. So, many organizations that are constantly just solving the same problem over and over again like, "Oh, we can never get along. We can never get these two teams to work together.
:
This team is always slow." And so you put the bandaid, but the bandaid doesn't work. So an organizational memories tend to be surprisingly short. So we forget three months ago we put this bandaid and it's no longer working, we just approach it as, "Oh, let's create a new solution." So voila, there's a new meeting. And so that's where that honesty is important. And memory is important, that no, no, no, this is a bandaid we put, but the problem still exists. So it's probably not an execution issue. I
Lenny :
Love that visual of a bandaid falling off. Okay. So, this it's segue to our fifth and final big idea, maybe the most mind bending of all your ideas that I want to talk about. And it's about prioritization and you make this really interesting point that instead of thinking about the highest ROI work you should be doing, which is how I've always thought about it, how I think most PMs think about prioritization. Your point is you should think about it from a minimizing opportunity cost perspective versus an ROI perspective. And so, I'm excited to hear your take on this and where this idea came from.
Shreyas Doshi :
Yeah. I think I learned this by just observing Patrick at Stripe, particularly over the last couple of years that I was there. And then I encapsulated what I learned and observed in this tweet, which is when you are in a high leverage role, you should stop doing work that simply provides a positive return on investment, ROI. And you should start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost and what drives that is the observation that in a high leverage role, so product management is good example of a high leverage role, founders by definition are in a high leverage role, engineering leaders, design leaders, designers, these are all fairly high leverage roles. And in a high leverage role, there will be hundreds of things that you can do that will provide a positive ROI. And what is positive ROI? It's simply that the value created is greater than the value of your time that essentially will ensure positive ROI more than zero.
:
So, the problem is you should not be doing most of these things. And the reason this ROI mindset is suboptimal and perhaps even harmful in high leverage roles, the formula for ROIs value created minus cost of your time divided by the cost of your time. So, the cost of your time is in the denominator. And just for the sake of simplicity, let's just call it time taken. So when the time taken to do something is in the denominator and whether it's at an individual level or at a team level, what we end up doing to get high ROI on our work is we end up trying to decrease the denominator. So when it's a ratio and you decrease the denominator, the value of the ratio grows. And so, how do you decrease the denominator in this case where time is the denominator is you start working on things that take less time.
:
So you start working on the low hanging fruit. You start prioritizing the quick wins. And the quick wins are very popular. Any team meeting or sprint meeting, "Oh, that's a quick win. Yeah, let's do it." And I don't have anything against quick wins. The problem is we just fill up our plate with quick wins. And while that may be fine, in most cases, in most situations in high leverage roles, you miss the upside and you miss the opportunity that you could have gained by focusing on other things. Let's take opportunity costs now like, how do you calculate opportunity costs? Opportunity cost is simply the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option. So the difference between what could have been the optimal option to pick and the option you did pick is the opportunity cost. So you need to minimize the opportunity cost, meaning you need to be working on the optimal things.
:
So when we reprogram ourselves to think in terms of opportunity cost, we are no longer thinking, "Oh, is this a good use of my time?" Instead, you are thinking, "Is this the best use of my time?" And it's a subtle but profound shift in our thinking. Because when we think about opportunity cost, we will pick certain things that we would've never picked if we just had it the ROI mindset. And again, this applies equally at the level of individuals of the work we decide to do as individuals on a day-to-day basis and the work we do with our teams, the things we prioritize. So that's the basis of this statement that you should try to minimize opportunity costs and focus on those things rather than simply chasing positive ROI.
Lenny :
Is there an example that comes to mind when you did this or maybe did it the wrong way that helped inspire this idea? Or is this just more of a broad lesson that you've learned over time?
Shreyas Doshi :
Oh, I mean, I saw that all the time, the work I did at pretty much every company. And again, I've been guilty of this myself where I think typically the type of situation where I have seen this as an example is you are trying to prioritize the next quarter. There are five sure things you can do that will have small to medium impact, and it's very clear. And then there are two ambiguous things that perhaps deep down you know you should pursue them, but you don't end up picking them because it's, again, you're satisfying yourself by observing, "Oh, each of these is positive ROI. Each of these five things that we can do that are very well defined as positive ROI." And so you don't touch those two things. Now, it could be that one of those things could meaningfully change the trajectory of your business, but doing that requires more work to figure that out, to flesh it out.
:
But we convince ourselves that positive ROI is great. And so we make ourselves busy and this is what I have seen myself do, I've seen other teams do. And certainly when I sit down with PMs often or even founders, I find that there is this gravitation towards these types of tasks, which are simply providing positive ROI. So it shows up most often in our planning, essentially. And again, I'm not against things that are quick wins or things that provide positive ROI, but I always want to check what are some big opportunities that we are not paying attention to by default and under what scenarios can we start chasing that.
:
So when I started working on Stripe Connect, which is a major, major product for Stripe and a large business for Stripe, there was a time when I noticed when I just started working on it, I noticed the team was working on a lot of positive ROI things. And I came in and it just simply instigated that like, "Hey, how about we work on this big scary project? Because I was hearing from customers that there is some need and that the instinct that this need is going to grow over time of being able to manage marketplace payments in a more flexible way." And we wouldn't have looked at it if we were just focused on positive ROI, but as we started looking at it, we realized, "Oh yes, this is a huge opportunity." And we were able to then pursue it because we were of shifting the mindset from just positive ROI to minimizing opportunity cost.
Lenny :
One more question along this line, just tactically, every PM ends up with a spreadsheet of their ideas and ROI and cost and benefit and all that stuff. Do you recommend folks create a column for opportunity cost or is this more of a broad thought process you go through when you're looking through your list of ideas?
Shreyas Doshi :
Yeah, it's more the latter. I do not recommend trying to quantify opportunity costs because it's a lost cost. Instead, what teams need is just sometimes the freedom and sometimes just permission to explore and attack these things that minimize opportunity costs. And so, as leaders, that's the best thing we can do is to give the teams that freedom or the permission to pursue these things and the way it manifests. And the way I've tried to do it is when we are planning, I often give guidance to the team around what percentage of our time we want to spend on what type of activity. And I learned this from Google's classic 70-20-10%, where during its fast growth years, Google had the 70% search and ads, 20% apps, which was things like Gmail and whatnot, and 10% on other big bets.
:
So, I have found that approach very useful during planning. Again, depends on the context, but when the team is starting to plan the next quarter or the next half or the next year, my role as a leader is hopefully I've already clarified the strategy so they have that as an input. But the other thing that I see in my role as a leader is to clarify the rough allocation. So what I'll share as a guidance with the team is given our situation and given our strategy and given what's going on in the market, I would like us to target about 60% of our time on incrementals. And by that, I mean incremental features that improve users' lives on a day-to-day basis. So these are actually high ROI things that we do, and again, these numbers are whatever they are, pick whatever is right for you, but 60% I want to go towards incrementals. 30% I want to allocate towards big new initiatives.
:
And because it's 30%, it can't be five big new initiatives, it's probably one or two. And then 10% I'd like us to allocate towards stability and infrastructure. So this is the guidance I'll share with the team. And then I will ask the teams to create their plans and proposals based on this guidance. So, this gives people the space to say, "Okay, we do have this 30%, so there's no sense putting in more high ROI tasks in there or quick wins in there." And I think just the simple guidance enables the team to just do the right thing. And I often get surprised with all the awesome stuff they come back with.
Lenny :
I really like that rule of thumb, what an excellent nugget to include along with this big idea. I'm realizing we're going for an hour and a half now, and I don't want to suck up all your time. So there's this idea that I think it might be a really good one to end on. It'll be a bonus sixth big idea around high agency and the importance of PMs being high agency. And the reason that it stuck out to me is this, I found to be really important in my career. And I think led a lot of the success that I saw along the way is just always feeling like I have agency and feeling ownership of what I was doing and where I was going. And so, I'm curious to hear your take on this and to dive into this trade of high agency and how important that is for PMs.
Shreyas Doshi :
I think Eric Weinstein coined this term high agency, which once I discovered it resonated a lot and aligned with some of my ideas and the way I had defined this concept in my head for many years, that high agency is about finding a way to get what you want without waiting for conditions to be perfect or otherwise blaming the circumstances. And so, we've all seen such people, they just either push through in the face of adverse conditions or often they manage to reverse the adverse conditions to achieve their goals. And so, while this is an important trait for many areas in endeavors, I think this is particularly important for product managers because as product managers, we are constantly fighting adverse conditions, not enough resources, challenges with legacy infrastructure, staffing issues, customer problems, and on and on. There's no dirt of problems to solve as a product manager.
:
And I noticed consistently over the years that as I started thinking about what differentiates the PMs who've had just a large impact and even more important than just impact to the company or to the team, PMs who've surprised me in a positive way, PMs who've really exceeded expectations, exceeded perhaps their own capabilities on paper. You see somebody's credentials on paper and then you see their work and their impact. And there's a big difference between what you might assume on paper and the impact they're achieving. And also, the reverse of that, which is sometimes you have PMs who just have tremendous potential. They look great on paper and you know when you're working with them or you're managing them that they're not achieving that potential, they're nowhere close to achieving that potential. And as I look at both of those situations, it became clear to me that high agency was a big contributor, which is the PMs in this first category were despite all the disadvantages and other things, they just took strong ownership.
:
So ownership is one component. Ownership mindset is one component of high agency. They took strong ownership and then they creatively executed through the challenges. So a creative execution is another aspect of high agency and they did that with a high degree of resilience, which is a third aspect of high agency. And so, as I realized that it became very clear as to why this was happening. And then it's one of those things that once you see it, you start seeing it in people much more clearly. And so, that's when I wrote about the PM version of high agency, I think that's why it resonated with a lot of people because, again, it gave vocabulary to people for what they already understood and they had seen it, but did not have the words for.
Lenny :
I think that's a really good way to wrap this up, just leaving people at that point of just the empowerment, basically taking responsibility, feeling high agency resiliency. Shreyas, this has been incredibly illuminating. I suspect this is going to be helpful to a lot of product managers and even non-product managers. And so, just two last questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or learn more and then how can listeners be useful to you?
Shreyas Doshi :
Yeah. So follow me on Twitter and just @shreyas. If you don't have a Twitter account, follow me on LinkedIn, you can just find me there Shreyas Doshi. If you really enjoy the tweets and want to see more, then you can super follow me on Twitter. So this is a smaller community that I'm really enjoying of product managers, founders, product people, designers, engineers, etc. where we go much deeper into these types of topics and more. And if you'd like to learn more about my views on various things related to product, super following me perhaps is a great way to do that.
:
And in terms of other things I'm working on, I am going to be launching a course on product sense and product management later this year, so be on the lookout for that, if that's of interest. And then lastly, I think the best help I can ask for from listeners is just if any of these ideas resonated with you, share them with others. And of course, if there are questions, feel free to ask. But I think my mission here is to really help perhaps bring greater clarity on what is going on around us when we are working in teams and working on projects and products. And so, I really like it when people share the ideas, whether it's on Twitter or publicly, or even with others privately. So that is perhaps the best thing you can do, help me in my mission.
Lenny :
Amazing. What a beautiful way to end it. Shreyas, thank you so much for this conversation.
Shreyas Doshi :
Thanks, Lenny. This was a blast. Thanks for having me. It's really a privilege and I am looking forward to another conversation sometime in the future.
