Lenny Rachitsky :
200 million.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay.
Garrett Lord :
So, we have 600-ish super passionate teammates that work on the core business, which I would separate those. These aren't two businesses, I think it's one business, but what is that business? If you're a young person in America that's graduated in the last five, six, seven, eight years, you probably have Handshake on your phone. You definitely know what Handshake is. It's a verb with young people in...

47:39] different answers working with the number one lab, and have just now we're working with Devin on the Frontier Labs and the number one thing we're trying to do is just focus on scaling up. And we've gone from four or five people working on this to 75 plus people working on it. I think we had 12 people start last Monday. It's like we are so bottlenecked on just meeting this opportunity, because in this market there's essentially unlimited demand. If you can produce high quality volumes of d...

### Yeah. I mean, I just really believe in separate and everything. Separate engineering team, separate design team, separate accounts and operations team, separate finance team. Early on, everything was separate. People only had one job and one job only, and that was making Handshake AI successful. We had a couple integration points more, and I had an incredible executive team and a core part of business, and now there's becoming more and more involvement. But our executives that have built Handshake for a long time ran the core business, and I focused 80 plus percent of my time and attention on just this. And we hired an incredible engineering leader like Avery, who ... We have a lot of entrepreneurs, people that have started companies inside the company. Or pardon me, people that started companies before. That was huge. A lot of familiarity with hiring talent that have only worked at early stage companies so [inaudible 00

We were also way more upfront around this is going to be chaotic. Just owning that narrative in front of all hands at the core company, owning it directly with the team. We have a separate all hands, we have separate onboarding, we have a separate recruiting team. I had some connection points, but mostly separate. And I think that was absolutely critical. We took some of the top people, I mean, we have great people in the core business, we to...

**Yeah, that network does about 200 million. This will do about [inaudible 00**:

37:21]
Lenny Rachitsky :
200 million.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay.
Garrett Lord :
So, we have 600-ish super passionate teammates that work on the core business, which I would separate those. These aren't two businesses, I think it's one business, but what is that business? If you're a young person in America that's graduated in the last five, six, seven, eight years, you probably have Handshake on your phone. You definitely know what Handshake is. It's a verb with young people in America, it's a verb with people that are in college in their PhD or master's program, and it is, I call it an unconnected graph, meaning you don't need to ... LinkedIn is very focused on who you know and what your experience is. The first question on LinkedIn is what's your job? And a lot of young people start off, they've never had a job before. They don't have 500 connections to add to their graph.
:
Whereas on Handshake, you start off trying to discover, and explore, and figure out how to navigate through school and figure out, "Oh, I'm an engineer. Maybe I want to be a PM, maybe I want to work at a startup, maybe I want to go to a larger company." What are the pros and cons you want to learn from your peers and young alumni? And so, Handshake's this I call a very social platform with groups, and messaging, and profiles, and short-form video and feed, all focused on your interests and helping really build your confidence in your early career to find your first job, your second job, and to manage 18 to 30, I would say.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And how long has that business been around?
Garrett Lord :
It's been around 10 years.
Lenny Rachitsky :
10 years, okay. So it's just again, it just feels like such a holy shit, you guys are in the right place in the right time with the right network that is extremely valuable now. What an interesting story. I feel like it's just another interesting example of you've been doing something for a long time and then all of a sudden AI is just, opens up a whole new way of leveraging something that you have been doing for a long time. It makes me think a little better about Bolt, and StackBlitz, which was building for seven years this browser based OS where you could run an OS in the browser. And they're like, "I don't know, no one needs this. What are we doing?" And then, all of a sudden AI and they're like, "Oh, what if we build AI apps in the browser and just generate products for you with AI?" And now it's, I don't know, one of the fastest growing companies in the world.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So interesting. And so, I think this is just an interesting time for our people to think about what have we done that may give us a new opportunity to build something huge based on this unfair advantage that we have?
Garrett Lord :
I think also as your company grows in size and headcount, and maturity, it's also hard to incubate something new inside of a business. It's hard in so many ways. The way that you build zero to one, and find product market fit, and scale a team very quickly and is very different than the way that you run a more mature business that has been around for 10 years with hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people. So, I've really had a ton of fun and found a ton of passion in running it back again for the second time inside the business. And then yeah, we have this massive strategic advantage, which is no cost or acquisition costs, and we have much higher conversion rates and retention than any of the other platforms by a large margin because we have such consumer affinity.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There's actually two threads here I want to follow, I'm going to follow the second one first, this idea of where this data labeling work can come from. This isn't a really clear, simple, understandable one, which is just experts sitting there creating data. Another one that I know a lot of other companies in this space use Scale, I know especially with just like low-cost labor internationally. Are there other methods for doing this that isn't one of those two? How are other companies doing this?
Garrett Lord :
I think if you care about building a really high quality business, and having good gross margin and high quality growth, the ecosystem here is, one of the leading players, they have 200 recruiters. It's unsustainable. There are like 200 people on LinkedIn sending individual messages to acquire these people, because there's no brand, there's no trust. They're spending tens of millions of dollars a month on performance advertising, Google Ads-
Lenny Rachitsky :
To find experts and to find folks.
Garrett Lord :
Find experts.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And it's experts mostly at this point.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah. And then they put them onto an experience that is treating them like they're drawing boundary boxes around stop signs in the Philippines. The frontier tax accountants don't want to be treated like low cost international labor, and I don't think anyone enjoys that process. And so, the ability to build a experience that's rooted in community, that's rooted in high quality training. If you're getting your PhD at MIT, chances are you're just not being taught well enough on how to use the tools.
:
It's not you can't break the models, it's just like the other platforms, they're spending thousands of hours to acquire an individual user and they're put right into a project with no training. So, we just started from day one at building this expert ... We believe there'd be a deep network effect here that's very connected to our core business of starting, jumpstarting or restarting your career. And you come in, you build a profile, you see the community, there's groups and a feed of here's how people are learning. You come into actual individual cohort with peers that look like you and have your similar background. You're being taught on how to interact, and there's a trial and error, and we have an instructional design piece so you can't do it. Then you're put on the projects where building ... There's certain swim lanes where we're actually pre-building data and selling that data to all the labs.
:
So, we can do this thing where we produce one unit of data ourselves. We pay for it, almost like a movie production. We pay for a unit of data, and then we make sure it's very high quality. We run our own post-training on it, and then we produce a bunch of specifications of the data, and we actually sell that individual package of data to many different labs. And so, you get put on a project like that. Once you're doing a really, really good job on our projects, oftentimes then we'll put you on customer projects where they only want the best of the best people in machine learning. And then they go from our projects to their projects. And so, there's a huge customer acquisition. You love going deep on your podcast, so just to talk about it, it's like you really have a couple of things that matter.
:
You have a cost to customer acquisition, your CAC, and then you have your LTV, like the lifetime value of a user. And an LTV is calculated pretty simply in this business. It is based on the retention of a person, and how many projects they can participate in. So, if you treat people really well, you train them really well, well, A, we have no customer acquisition costs because we partner with 1,600 universities, power 92% of the top 500 schools in the country. We power almost every institution and community college in the country. We have no customer acquisition cost to acquire the people. We have a ton of brand and trust with them built up, so they convert at really, really high rates. And then, if you treat them really well, because what they expect from us, they know Handshake, their school buys Handshake, we care about treating these people well but the universities would not tolerate our partnership with these fellows unless we treated them well.
:
So, you put them into this process where our LTVs and repeat engagement rate and retention rate on different projects is really high. And so, these structural advantages are quite significant when you contrast a leading provider that has 200 individual contributing recruiters, and are spending tens of millions of dollars a month on performance marketing. So, that's I think why we've seen so much success.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's extremely interesting. And it feels like, as you said, there used to be a big focus on generalists, which is people anywhere in the world for low-cost can do the work, like draw bounding boxes around things. And essentially the market has shifted from low-cost generalists to experts. And a lot of these companies like Scale, we're optimizing for general work model training data, and you guys are set up to be extremely good at expert based data. And so, you're in the right place at the right time, at the right supply. What a business.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Nice work.
Garrett Lord :
I would say it's not been easy building business two inside of business one, but-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. So, let me follow that thread. That's where I wanted to go. What was just that like? So, you started noticing that model companies were coming to your people, that people were having hard times with some of these other companies in this space and you're like, "Oh, maybe we should be doing this sort of thing"? How did that just initial inception start, and how did you start to explore that idea and to see if it was a real thing?
Garrett Lord :
Tactically we were working with many of the middleman companies doing work. We started to see the demand, as I talked about earlier. We started to see direct outreach from the Frontier Labs reaching out to us, trying to cut out the middleman in their pursuit of getting higher-quality data. When we started to put together the dots on we could build a way better experience for our fellows, we could serve them directly to the labs and build a direct customer relationship with the labs, and basically cut out the middleman. And provide a better experience to the labs, provide a better experience to our fellows and provide a better experience to our million companies in the network.
:
And you might think about just upskilling and reskilling, what's going to happen there. So, we walked into this space. We started in really December, exploring and learning more about it, like on expert calls and hammering down. I hired three expert firms, AlphaSights and GLG, and started doing a bunch of calls with the latest researchers, because we had resources. One of the cool things about being a larger company is our core business is $200 million ARR, so it's like we had resources to be able to accelerate the learning curve here. And then, we started working with arguably the number one lab about five months ago.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I wonder who that is.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, wonder who it is.
Garrett Lord :

**[inaudible 00**:

47:39] different answers working with the number one lab, and have just now we're working with Devin on the Frontier Labs and the number one thing we're trying to do is just focus on scaling up. And we've gone from four or five people working on this to 75 plus people working on it. I think we had 12 people start last Monday. It's like we are so bottlenecked on just meeting this opportunity, because in this market there's essentially unlimited demand. If you can produce high quality volumes of data, you most likely will be able to sell whatever you produce. And so on our side, it's like we're really focused on making sure that we pick the right longer term strategy, making sure that we don't grow too fast as to erode the trust that we've built up with these Frontier labs. Yeah, but it's been fun.
Lenny Rachitsky :
You said it's also been really hard to start those business within an existing business. What's been hard? What's been hardest? You touched on a couple of these elements already, but what else?
Garrett Lord :
I think I just followed a lot more of my intuition around this, doing this. The story of Handshake was we had to sign up 1,600 universities, so I had to learn how to be the best ... We are the fastest growing higher education company in history. So, we signed up six 1,600 schools. Then we had to build an employer business, where we had to figure out how to sell the 100% ... All these Fortune 500 companies use it and 70% of it pay for it, so I had to learn about upmarket sales to Goldman Sachs, and General Motors, and Google and the biggest companies in the world, which is totally different than selling universities. And then we had to learn how to build an incredible student social network. What does the best feed look like? What does group messaging look like? So, I felt a little bit of familiarity in those zero to ones.
:
Oftentimes marketplaces are like many zero to ones. Sometimes I dream that we just, I actually don't dream, but I make a joke that I just wish we were a cybersecurity company and we had one buyer and just one product, and it was just like we had to ... In a marketplace, you have to serve three different sides, you know from your time at Airbnb. And so, one of my learnings in spinning up these three different businesses in starting Handshake was I was pretty hands-on. So, everyone reported directly to me. I really said in a lot of meetings, "I'm not trying to be the boss, I'm just trying to get another smart guy in the room." We've hired an incredible team of people that have spent a lot of time in the space and have been big leaders at a lot of the human data companies in the space.
:
And so, everyone saw very clearly the structural advantages that we had, and a lot of the focus was on making sure that we could deliver high-quality data to one customer before we expand to anyone else. You had to say no to a lot of things. And then, you also had a lot of people in the core part of the business that, rightfully so, there's just checks and balances that there's a lot of people that try to get involved. Everyone wants to say, not everyone, this is a stretch, but it's easy to say no. It's easy to be like, "I can't prioritize that this week or this month. I have an existing set of priorities." So essentially, with the exception of a few things, everyone just came straight into this new org that I built, everyone did not have any responsibilities in the existing part of the business. It was extremely clear who was the directly responsible individual across each area of the new co. And now we've got deeper coupling and integration points across the rest of the business, but we sat in a separate part of the office.
:
Everyone's in the office five days a week, a lot of weekends. There's a totally different expectation in hiring talent too, where it's like, "Hey, this is a 24/7 job. This is an early-stage company." The compensation was also different too, and based on hurdles in this new business so people felt owners creating the new co. And yeah, it's still extremely nimble, very, very flat. Just because you run one function doesn't mean you're the directly responsible individual on a project. We pick the best person who's most capable of driving an initiative forward, regardless of the function to be the DRI. We're a lot more metrics-oriented. When I built Handshake, we resisted this operating cadence for a long time, this weekly, monthly, quarterly operating cadence. With Handshake AI, we've been way more focused on operating with data, and metrics, and rigor from an early stage. There's a gentleman named Sahil on our team who's been doing an incredible job with that. Shout out Sahil, shout out young, shout out Paco. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, this is incredible. So, a few elements of what allowed this to succeed within a decade-old company. And by the way, so you're at 200 million a year in revenue with the traditional business. You're going to, as you said, blow past 100 million in the first year of this new business. So, it's wild that in the first couple years, if things continue to go this way, you'll exceed the run rate of a business that took you 10 years to build. Incredible. To make this successful, a few of the things I noted as you were talking, one is clearly you were just in founder mode. You're the lead of this new business. You weren't delegating it to someone, "Hey, go start this thing." You dedicated people, "Here, we're going to pick people. You have nothing else going on, this is your new job. You're going to work on this stuff."
:
You worked in different part of the office. There's a metrics-based cadence. It's just like, let's stay really diligent about here's how it's going, here's where we're going, here's our track, here's our KPIs, things like that. Anything else there that you felt really important to making this work? Because a lot of companies are going to try to do this, I imagine, and so I'm curious what else you found important to make this work.
Garrett Lord :

**Yeah. I mean, I just really believe in separate and everything. Separate engineering team, separate design team, separate accounts and operations team, separate finance team. Early on, everything was separate. People only had one job and one job only, and that was making Handshake AI successful. We had a couple integration points more, and I had an incredible executive team and a core part of business, and now there's becoming more and more involvement. But our executives that have built Handshake for a long time ran the core business, and I focused 80 plus percent of my time and attention on just this. And we hired an incredible engineering leader like Avery, who ... We have a lot of entrepreneurs, people that have started companies inside the company. Or pardon me, people that started companies before. That was huge. A lot of familiarity with hiring talent that have only worked at early stage companies so [inaudible 00**:

54:44] that feels super comfortable with ambiguity.
:
We were also way more upfront around this is going to be chaotic. Just owning that narrative in front of all hands at the core company, owning it directly with the team. We have a separate all hands, we have separate onboarding, we have a separate recruiting team. I had some connection points, but mostly separate. And I think that was absolutely critical. We took some of the top people, I mean, we have great people in the core business, we took some great people from the core businesses and basically said, "Sorry, I know you love your old team. I know you love what you're doing. Will you join us in Handshake AI?" And they completely forego their historical responsibilities and came over. That became really critical with engineering when things started to scale and topple, and we're growing so quickly we took some of our top senior engineers, who were very entrepreneurial, and principal engineers, staff of engineers, parachute them in. It's been awesome to ask some of the most talented people in the core business like, "Hey, do you want to come over here and do this?"
:

**And sometimes they say no. They're like, "I don't want to work most of the weekends." The number of 2**:

00 AM, 3:00 AM nights we done in this business, I mean, it's quite regular. People sometimes don't want to commit to that, but we've been up front, like here are the expectations for this team. It's an insane pace. If you want to be a part of one of the fastest growing businesses in Silicon Valley, you can join it. The ownership too has also been huge, like owning this outcome, and we have this motto to leave nothing to chance. For a while there we drew the number of days in the year on the whiteboard and it was like, there will never be a time like this. I've never seen anything like it, I doubt I'll ever feel anything like this in business again where there's unlimited demand and it's just our ability to execute against it.
:
And so, we had this motto like leave nothing to chance. How do you make sure that three months are not six months? You have no regrets. Get on the plane to go talk to a customer, make the late night push, check the data six times over again, ship the extra feature that helps. And really, a huge celebratory culture too. It's very flat so there really isn't this principle of ... There's so many people putting up points, directly calling out the people that are putting up points and creating a really fun environment around impact I think has been awesome.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The leave nothing to chance piece I imagine speaks partly to the value of trust in what you're doing. You win if they can trust that your data's awesome, and great, and consistent, and I could see why that ends up being such an important part of what you're building. And just listening to you describe this, I understand it's obviously a massive opportunity, obviously a massive advantage you guys have, and just the stress that comes with that burden also imagine is very high of just like we can't screw this up.
Garrett Lord :
No. Yes, Handshake should be a ... Business does billions dollars revenue as a public company, we should be able to continue to ... I mean, and it also helps our core business. The longer term opportunity that we see is it's connecting, it's building the best job mashing marketplace on the internet. It's probably one of the largest problems in the world like labor supply mashing. It's where people spend most of their time and energy, just hours of their life they spend it at work. The process of searching for a job, applying to a job is going to be completely reinvented with AI. We've been leading the charge there. An AI interviewer that's collecting skills and actually asking about your experiences, doing work simulation experiences that help employers find the best candidates. I mean, I don't know the last time you've done this, but the hiring manager process, reviewing 200 resumes, are you kidding me?
:
I'm going to sit there and review 200 resumes? Not a chance five years from now. Students manually making cover ... Not a chance. So, there will need to be a marketplace that wins in connecting supply and demand, and talent with opportunity, and we think and get psyched about the opportunity for impact here. That's my story, I went to community college, I paid my way through school. I went to a no name school in Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I worked at Palantir as an intern, it totally changed my life, and I started Handshake because I wanted to make it easier for anyone regardless of who you knew, what your parents did, what school you went to, to find a great opportunity. And I think AI, totally step function improvement in matching. And I think that our human data business is really serving as the foundation for improving matching.
:
A lot of things that we're doing in the human data business are being integrated to our core business. I think that's going to improve outcomes for employers, save them in the aggregate like billions of dollars over time. And I think it makes the experience way better for students. So, it's just like we have to meet the moment. We still have the stamina, and the excitement, and the passion internally in our core and in the new business to go charge after this. And that's a lot of the message we've been sharing internally is it's time to amp it up. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be positioned as well, and we are going to make the moment as a team.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It really is. This very much feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity. Let me ask a few other questions along these lines that are something I've been thinking about, something that a lot of people think about, just while I have you, there's always this question of will we run out of data? Will model stop advancing? Are we going to hit some plateau and there's not actually going to be some AGI moment, SGI moment? So first of all, do you think we'll run out of data? There's a point at which we just can't produce more knowledge and data to feed these models? And along those lines, what do you think is the biggest bottleneck to advancing models faster and further?
Garrett Lord :
Yeah, I mean, it's just the type of data we're going to need is going to evolve. It's going to be CAD files, it's going to be scientific tool use data as they try to automate scientific discoveries and drug discovery. It's going to be esoteric operating systems that exist on scientific tools. So, I love this trajectory and stitching together step-by-step instruction following. The type of data we're going to need is going to evolve a lot. And we haven't even talked about multimodal, and video, and text and audio. There's a huge demand for audio data right now. So, the type of data's going to evolve.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, I use voice mode all the time. That's on my default ChatGPT experience, just talking to-
Garrett Lord :
It's amazing. It's amazing. I just had a baby on, or my wife had a baby on Sunday, and voice mode's been incredible. I mean, every night, every two hours it's like I have more questions. Voice mode's been huge. So, shot out voice mode. Yeah, so the type of data is going to collect a lot, or change a lot. I think synthetic data has a role to play and in verifiable domains, but what we consistently hear from companies it's like synthetic data is not going to dominate. There's billions, and billions, and billions of dollars of value to extract as a company over the next decade and following the frontier of AI development.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let me first say just huge kudos to you for just having a kid, your wife just having a kid a few days ago, and building this business that is growing bananas and doing this podcast conversation. I really appreciate you.
Garrett Lord :
Thank you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Of course. Is there anything else that we haven't covered that you think might be helpful for folks to hear, or a part of your story that you think might be helpful for folks to learn from, or something you may want to just double down on that we've talked about before we get to a very exciting lightning round?
Garrett Lord :
I mean, the thing I always love talking, I'm really passionate about people starting companies and helping them do so. I just think in this moment right now with AI, for young entrepreneurs that listen, that read this podcast, because I've been a reader since 2020. We looked.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, we did check. That's incredible.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah, been a long-term reader. I'm just so curious and love sucking up-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Appreciate it.
Garrett Lord :
... your interviews. But it's like you just focus on doing something of meaning that really helps people. And I think with AI, there's going to be so many opportunities to improve the way people learn. I'm just really passionate about trying to make Handshake a platform that is not only an incredible business, but is also something that really helps solve a societal problem that matters. And yeah, that's be my one shout out here. If anyone wants advice on how to do that or wants to reach out, I'm happy to chat.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, so this is an offer to share advice on starting companies within AI. Is that the offer here? Just so folks-
Garrett Lord :
Yeah, that'd be great.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. I don't know how much time you'll have for the hundreds of thousands of people coming your way, but I appreciate the offer. That's very cool. Anything else before we get to a very exciting lightning round?
Garrett Lord :
No.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Well, with that Garrett, we reached our very exciting lightning round. We've got five questions for you. Are you ready?
Garrett Lord :
Ready.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
Garrett Lord :
I'm a sucker for Peter Thiel's Zero to One. I read it when I started the company, and watched Peter Thiel's startup school class at Stanford he taught back in the days where there wasn't everything written on the internet about how to start companies, and just think he was the coolest. Love Shoe Dog. I think it's the epitome of starting a company. Hard Things About Hard Things obviously, but these are all quite common books.
Lenny Rachitsky :
But also classics. Ben Horowitz is coming on the podcast, talk about Hard Things About Hard Things.
Garrett Lord :
Super cool.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The Hard Thing About Hard Things. Yeah. Okay, have you seen a recent movie or TV show you really enjoy it? I imagine you don't have much time for this, but-
Garrett Lord :
I'm going to get blasted for this, but I did start Game of Thrones with my wife, and I cannot-
Lenny Rachitsky :
For the first time.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, cool.
Garrett Lord :
So, I got a lot of catching up to do.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Why would you get ... No, this is great. It's like people that have watched it-
Garrett Lord :
I've loved it so far.
Lenny Rachitsky :
You've loved it so far? Okay. It's quite gruesome, that's the only downside of that show. Don't watch it before you go to bed, I don't know how many gruesome scenes you've seen already. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?
Garrett Lord :
The SNOO. The baby automated SNOO has really helped us a lot. So love the, shout-out SNOO team.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. I had a SNOO as well. We never actually turned it on, we just ended up using it as a basinet the whole time.
Garrett Lord :
Yeah, most of the time it's not turned on, but a couple of cries it's been turned on, it's been very helpful.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Do you have favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with other people?
Garrett Lord :
I love that leave nothing to chance, leave it all out on the field. Grew up in a really hardworking family, and dad worked really hard to provide, make it happen for us and it's like just give it your all. Leave nothing a chance.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. So the last question, I was researching you in prep for this podcast and there's a story that I love about your hustle early on is when you were going from campus to campus pitching schools to join Handshake, and there's a story where you had to shower in the Princeton's pool to save money because you just didn't have a place to stay. Is there something there? Is there a story there you could share?
Garrett Lord :
Yeah, so it was a tough one. I mean, I almost got arrested at Princeton, because I mean, I guess for entrepreneurs that are traveling around all the time, we were sleeping out of our car. We had this Ford focus, we would put 20, 30,000 miles on it, sleep in the back of like McDonald's parking lots because they're well lit and had good wifi back in the day. And instead of staying in a hotel, a way to freshen up ahead of your meeting is every university has a pool and the pool's almost always, it is always open. We never had a situation where it's always open for people to swim in the morning, like fitness. Faculty, students. And every pool, what do they have? They have a shower.
:
So, you could go to any pool at any university in the country, and you can get a free shower and freshen up. So, the Princeton campus security did not appreciate me showering as a non-student, but I think it meaningfully helped us because the Princeton campus security called the career service center director we were selling to, being like, "Who's Garrett Lord? Is he really here to pitch you software for your career center?" And it made the start of the meeting with the career center really stimulating and exciting, because they were like, "You showered in our pool, you drove here?" "Yeah, we drove here from Michigan." And so, I think that showed a level of commitment that was exciting for them.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Fast-forward to all these founders now starting to use this growth lever of getting in trouble with the campus police to get better meetings with the school leaders. Incredible. Garrett, this is such an insane, amazing, inspiring story, just like what you're building and the opportunity here, and just how it's fast, it's going, and all the advantages you have. If I was an investor in Handshake, I'd be like, "All right, 10 years, it's going great." And now it's like, "Whoa, holy shit. Where did this come from?" Incredible. And it's just also really meaningful. So, I'm really happy that you made time for this in spite of the madness you are in right now. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out or maybe if you're hiring, let us know. And then, how can listeners be useful to you?
