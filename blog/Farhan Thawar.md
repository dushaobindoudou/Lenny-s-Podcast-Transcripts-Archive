57:04]
Farhan Thawar :
No, not really. Yeah. We're not super firm on working hours from that perspective, but we do have a lot of people on East Coast time zones. A lot of stuff happens then, but we do have people all over the world. But I did mention we do have the check-ins and the six-week reviews on the cadence. So that six week cycle does give you a little bit of the, what did you get done and are you blocked mentality. And you can expect coming in a couple of times and being like, "Hey, we didn't get a lot done being unblocked." For you to change your approach to go, "Okay, I don't want to go to another review where we didn't get a lot done." So what am I doing this time to make sure we unlock a lot of progress? And that check-in can give you that ammo to be like, "Let's do this this time."
Lenny Rachitsky :
And you're also remote first as a company.
Farhan Thawar :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Which I think is especially cool. Now a lot of companies are going back to not remote. You guys are staying remote. Why do you guys decide to do that? What have you seen as a big benefit of that?
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, so we have this remote, so I like to call it 90% remote or 95% remote because we have these intentional IRL experiences. So every summer, we just started last year. Sorry, this year. We're doing this thing called Shopify Summit where we bring the whole company together, get together and it's a combination of talks plus hack days and it's a come together experience like food and parties and bands. And it's a super fun way to re-energize and rebuild your trust battery over time. And then we have this thing called bursts, which is, "Hey, you want to work on a problem? You need to prototype, you need to hack." People can just say, "Hey, I'm starting a burst. We're going to have five people. We're all going to go to Ottawa or Toronto or Montreal or somewhere else and we're going to talk about this problem and get together."
:
And so a combination of those two things mean throughout the year, you can recharge. We have the trust battery notion, which is how much trust can you have between people and it can deplete over time if you're remote. So then we have offices which are like, come in if you want. Like I mentioned, I come in once a week and now Toby moved to Toronto, so now I'm in three days a week. But it's like if you want to come in, you don't have to, right? Today, I work from home, but tomorrow, I'm going in. And that allows you, again, to have those random interactions and allow you to feel like, yeah, we're 90 plus percent remote. But I would say the main reason is we want to hire the best people in the world and those people can be anywhere and just happens to be that not all of them are near an office.
:
But again, with the bursting, here's a good example. For Black Friday, Cyber Monday, I encouraged all engineering leadership to come to Toronto. We're all going to be in the office watching the graphs. And then for hack days, I try to get people to go to the ports, which we have four of them, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and New York, which again are come in if you want, but then get that IRL. And so it's kind of a little bit of a combo. I wouldn't call it hybrid though because you don't really have every Friday you come in or don't come in. It's more like, come in if you want.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There's so many things to talk about. This trust battery metaphor by the way is awesome. I've learned to use it also. And again, it's just basically everyone, your trust with someone is like, think of it as a battery that can deplete and grow and you should try to charge it up when you can and then use that charge over time.
Farhan Thawar :
And it can be strategic by the way. I've seen people use it as a... I'm pretty sure Toby says he starts everyone at 50% and then he gets to know you. And then I've seen people use it as the opposite, saying, "Hey, look, this team is hard charging. I'm going to start you at a hundred. Assume that you already have high trust, do the things, and only if you are doing things that are off alignment, does your trust battery deplete." So I've seen people use it, the terminology as a shortcut way to figure out how to work with somebody.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love just how first principles you all are, and there are so many things are so unique to how you operate and clearly it's working. And so I feel like we just keep going on and on. I want to talk about hiring. I know you have some pretty unique perspectives on how to hire people that are awesome, but also, hire them quickly. But before we get there, is there anything else that you think might be really valuable to share in terms of intensity, velocity, moving fast?
Farhan Thawar :
I think the personality of the leadership team is quite intense. We have a lot of founders on the exec team, which are impatient, intense people by design. But even some of the non-founders are just accomplished people who tend to be pretty, we all have this attitude of impatience, and so maybe, I don't even know if that's a learned skill you can learn or if it just comes along with your personality, like genetics. But we typically, even at the leadership team, for example, we try to do, here's my weekly thread of all the things that are going on so that we can not only share, but also show progress on things. And then someone can jump in and say, "Oh, this thing you're doing, it relates to my thing that I'm doing over here." It creates this notion of, there's a lot going on all the time and we want to keep the vibes, keep the energy high. So a lot of high energy intense people.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It reminds me while I was at Airbnb, it felt like no matter how well things are going, it always felt like Brian especially is just pedal to the metal. No matter how well things are going, it's not going well enough. How do we go faster? How do we do more?
Farhan Thawar :
Well, I would actually go further. I think if you don't have two or three big projects that are on fire, you're probably not pushing hard enough because you're not really trying things that are outside of your... If everything's going well, are you really taking the risks you need to be taking? So I think you have to over-rotate a bit and there should be a few things on fire at all times, not because you should create that, but it should just happen because you're stretching into new things that potentially or you're going faster than you should have, or there's a new leader you've counted on early because all these things that should create this thing of it might work. And so you want to have a little bit of chaos at the edge.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that. And it may sound stressful and why would I want that? Why would I want to work with chaos and fires everywhere? But in reality, if you don't, your business is unlikely to become incredibly successful and that is even more stressful and painful.
Farhan Thawar :
Correct. Yeah, it's like the opposite, right? It's like this idea of people feel like the comfort gives you stability, and really the uncomfort gives you stability because now you're constantly learning and that makes you more robust against things that could come across.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Choosing the harder path, some might say. Okay, let's talk about hiring. You have some really interesting takes on hiring. One that I've heard about is that you don't like the interview process. You kind of like to prefer not to interview and do something instead. Talk about that.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah. So throughout my career, what I've noticed is that, and I'm sure everybody, this is a dirty little secret, right? Interviews are not a good predictor of performance. We know this. We know this from studies. We know this. Everybody at their company knows this, where somebody interviewed well, wasn't as good in the job or the opposite, didn't interview well and then came in and was phenomenal. One example I have from my startup right before we came to Shopify was I hired two people for machine learning. One was a PhD, taught at the university, was like, oh my god, no brainer, was also recommended by an employee. We're like, "Oh my god, this person's going to be great." The other person was a dude I met at the coffee shop who had never had a software job but was just so interested in machine learning and person A, we let go within a few weeks because not a fit for our culture.
:
And person B was at our startup and is still at Shopify today and is a phenomenal machine learning engineer who literally at our Christmas party was like, "This is my first software job." We're like, "How?" It was just so cute. And we gave them both the shot. The key was I didn't use the resume in either way to bias. We brought them both in. We said, "Here's the environment." It was all pair programming at my startup. And so they pair program, and actually as an aside, I really believe in pair programming when I made people work in pair programming with my own money. I paid for two people to be on one computer. So that's how you know...
Lenny Rachitsky :
Less than half the code.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, exactly. Right. Less than half the code. But anyway, so pairing. And it was pretty clear after just a few weeks, I would say let's say up to three months is the amount of time I give people, that person A wasn't going to work out than person B was. So what I really like to do is use this race car analogy. If I told you, "Hey, I want to go hire the best race car driver," there's not really that many questions you could ask them except for put them in the car. And so the same thing happens with us is that of course, we have to do interviews, but we do really spend time in the 30, 60, 90 days to make sure that the thing that they are bringing actually lines up with what we need at Shopify. And you should also be transparent with people because if it's not a fit, it's actually good for them and you to figure that out as quickly as possible because they could be amazing somewhere else.
:
We mentioned the chaotic environment and fast moving environment Shopify is, that's not for everyone, but that's okay, right? We're not looking for... We've talked about that we want to be as the best 10,000 person company in the world. We're not looking for millions of people. We just need the best 10,000. And so if it's not a fit, it's in your interest and our interest to figure that out quickly so that you can go somewhere where you will be amazing and for us to have the people who will be amazing at Shopify. And so job trials, I'm a huge fan of, which leads me to intern programs, what a great interview process because you now have real work product from somebody for four months. They get to see what it's like to be at Shopify for four months. We get to see what it's like for them to be at Shopify for four months, and that can turn into a full-time gig.
:
And that's a great interview process because you literally know exactly. You don't have to... I'll give you a funny example. I think I've heard a company where, "Oh, we have an intern process and then afterwards, we interview them for full-time." I'm like, "What are you going to learn from let's say even eight hours of interviews that you're not going to have learned from four months of real work experience?" And so there's just things like that. You just got to look at the work product. And so I'm a big fan of job trials, and in my previous companies, like you mentioned, I almost didn't interview anybody. I almost just said, "Come in and work." And it allowed us... We had a much higher in the first 90 days, like 20% attrition before 90 days because it just didn't work out. But those after 90 days, we had less than 1% attrition because they knew exactly what they're getting into and we knew exactly how they were going to fit.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So in terms of the hiring process, you're still at Shopify. You're interviewing people, they're doing technical evaluations, things like that. But it sounds like there's a very strong setting of expectations. "We will hire you, but we'll actually clarify if this is a good fit in the first 30, 60, 90 days and we're going to do... We may let you go and there's a good chance we may let you go." Is that just the way you set things up?
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, I think the way to think about, it's more like we want to make the interview process as close to the real job as possible because by doing that, we can likely assess the skills that you have in your interview closer to what's happening in the job. So that's one. Two, we have this interview step called the life story where we try to figure out if, are all the experiences you've had up until now actually going to be... Does it show that you are a curious person with range? Because if it does, that's likely more of someone who's going to be a fit. I had this famous line from somebody who said, "You know what I don't like about resumes?" I'm like, "What?" They go, "It tells you what you did, but it doesn't tell you why you did those things."
:
And it's such an interesting insight. Your resume should be a why, like why did you go from this company to this? That's the interesting part. Not that you are a PM at Microsoft and a PM at Stripe. It's like, why did you switch from Stripe to Microsoft? There's something interesting there. And so the life story is trying to pull that out. It's like, why did you make the decisions? What did you do in your past that was interesting? Are you curious? I always thought... I read this great book, Range by David Epstein. That book was maybe one of the hardest books for me to read in my life because every page I was like, "I don't believe it." I kept thinking I was a specialist. I kept turning the page going, "I don't like this data that keeps showing that generalists are better." And then by the end, I realized that I'm a generalist. It took me so long to realize, and funny for me because I ended up redesigning the compensation system for Shopify, even though I'm an engineer.
:
So I still thought of myself as an engineer through and through, even though I work on recruiting and HR and all these other things. But I think that that's what we're trying to tease. And then yes, in that first period, we actually have a survey that goes over Slack that says, "Hey, how happy are you with the person that you hired?" And that should, in conversation with the person, you should give them the feedback to figure out, "Hey, are there things you need to adjust to better fit in and make sure the expectations are set up?" But then also, together with the person, figure out, "Hey, if you're not feeling this, let's find you either a different role in the company or somewhere else because we want the people here to have high impact." But that person should have high impact somewhere, could be at Shopify, could be in the same role, could be in a different role, could be at a different company. But that's a good thing for everybody.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And then do you actually do work trials with new engineering hires, or is that something you aspire to do?
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, I would love to do it. It's hard to do with the volume resumes we get, but we do do it at scale with the internship program. So like 2025, we're going to hire a thousand interns, and that is going to give me a thousand job trials to pick the top X percent of those to come to Shopify full time.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So just to double-click on that, so you're hiring a thousand interns over the course of the year. That's a lot. And the idea there is these folks are actually useful building useful things, and it's an interview process for the internship.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, I think it's two things. One is some people look at an internship program as community service. Let's give back to the community. Let's hire early talent. And I'm like, "Hold on a sec. Are you telling me I could hire a thousand people over the year?" And they will come to work with an LLM and a brain because they're growing up in the age of AI. They will be useful to us because they come from a different generation and they have, in our case in commerce, they have a different experience about shopping and AI and bots and chat and voice and all these things. They'll be useful to us. We'll teach them some stuff as well. And then together we can decide if they might end up going somewhere else, in which case, we have the Shopify imprint on them going to whatever other company, which is I think a positive, or they might stay at Shopify and be useful over a longer period.
:
It seems like win, win, win. The other thing that was cool is after I did that tweet, a bunch of other CTOs messaged me and said, "Hey, we're going to hire 1,001 interns to beat you guys." And I'm like, "Great." Just from that one tweet, if I can get the early talent ecosystem restarted here after a really tough last few years and layoffs, it's great for everybody because now they're realizing that they also realize that these people are super valuable and they bring together a completely different set of skills. And by the way, here's a secret in pair programming, interns will always be more intense than the full-time. And so that also helps the flywheel of intensity go for it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It all just keeps coming back. Did the internship program emerge out of this co-op system that Canadian schools have and a Waterloo has a big co-op program?
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, I went to Waterloo. And so yeah, hint, hint. So I went to Waterloo and I did co-op and I did intern programs there. It was amazing. What a great experience, because what ends up happening is you leave Waterloo with your degree, but also with two years of experience because I did six four-month work terms, 24 months, and you end up walking. I think one of the big parts of it is just interview skills because I interviewed for 10 plus jobs every four months, and I did that six times. And so you come out having done lots... You have a lot of interview experience, but you also have work experience. And so just taking that to the next level, Shopify has always had interns. And what I felt like we needed to do was, again, restart this notion of early talent in the ecosystem. I would say one or two big differences with our intern program.
:
One is we're making them come in three days a week versus full remote. And the reason for that is, and we're doing it just in three offices right now in Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa. And the reason for that is because we want them to have a cohort because early talent is different than you and I who've been in the industry. We worked in office, we worked out of office. We're more comfortable with navigating partnership discussions and talking to people in different companies. But these people have not. They may have never worked anywhere.
:
And so to not have the IRL component would do them a disservice. And so we specifically made it in those ports and the people are traveling by the way, they're moving to Montreal to do the internship. It's great. And then if you're a mentor or manager for one of the interns, you have to at least see them like IRL once a month. So we're kind of making these experiences. And of course, they'll have a cohort of dozens of people that will be with them along the way. And so we think that'll just make their experience better. And of course, nothing like tapping someone on the shoulder and be like, "Have you seen this era before?" And so it's easier in an early talent situation. And then of course over time, if they become full-time, they can still come to the office. It's come if you want, but they can also go full remote.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That is amazing. For folks that don't know anything about these co-op programs briefly, it's just basically while you're in school, before you graduated, during the summer, you go work at a company.
Farhan Thawar :
No.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh, during the year. Okay.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, it's during the year. So what happens at Waterloo is, what I did was I did eight months of school at the beginning. So two terms. My first co-op term was summer, but then it was work, school, work, school, alternating for the whole rest of my time at Waterloo.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's like semesters alternating.
Farhan Thawar :
Exactly. So every four months I did either school term or work time. So I was doing work in January sometimes and September sometimes. And it was super good because again, it also allowed me to be super intense at school for four months and then go to super intense work experience for four months. But yeah, it's a model that... I was just at Waterloo this week doing a talk, so I love that symbiotic relationship between Waterloo and the employers, by the way, not just Waterloo. Lots of schools do a summer program, UFT and others, lots of schools in the states.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Fun fact. So total tangent, I had a startup called Local Mine, started it in Montreal of all places. I'm not Canadian, but moved there for various reasons. It was awesome. And our first hire was actually from the co-op program. I don't know if it was Waterloo, his name is Nick Adams. And he applied. Just he saw our job posting, I think, and were like, "What is a co-op?" And he came to work and then he went back to school, and then we hired him, and then he ended up at Airbnb when we got a card.
Farhan Thawar :
There you go. So for us, actually, when I did my startup Helpful, I had one or two engineers, and then I actually literally just hired four interns because you hired them in February for May. And because I was doing pair programming, I had to make sure I had four full times by then. So I hired the interns in anticipation of having the full times. And I literally had, I think I was off by one week, so one intern had no pair for a week, but then after that in May, I had four full times, four interns, and then they paired the whole time.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What a journey. I want to talk about just one other topic real quick and then we'll wrap this up. And it's around XtremeLabs. So there's a bunch of stuff here. It feels like it's just like this tech mafia of Canada that a lot of incredible people emerged out of, and there's a whole bunch of stuff we can talk about. One fact I heard while you were there is you had a hundred reports, direct reports that reported to you.
Farhan Thawar :
A 120.
Lenny Rachitsky :
120 direct reports feels like a complete nightmare to me. Tell me why you decided to do that, if you'd recommend that for other people.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, so what ended up happening there was we started off small. It was 10 people. When I got to XtremeLabs, I wasn't the founder, but I was very early on and I just had everyone report to me. And then as we grew, I just kept having those people report to me and I was trying to figure out, we talked about crafters and crafters paradise, this idea of people don't really... Their managers are useful, but I was trying to figure out could I solve the problems that they needed their manager for in other ways? So for example, what should I be working on? I was like, "Okay, well, we have product backlogs" or "I'm blocked on something," or "I need feedback on the product I'm building," or "I'm stuck on this technical problem." I tried to figure out ways to not have managers be the answers to those questions.
:
I'm like, "There should be another answer." And so pair programming really helps you get unblocked quickly because you have another person that you can bounce technical ideas off of. Having a product backlog can tell you what to work on. We had demos every week, demos internally, and then we had demos with the clients every week because we were a contract manufacturing for mobile. That gave them feedback on whether they were going in the right direction. We had set working hours, which made things super intense in the office. This is again like 2009 to 2013. So all these things didn't really need a manager. And what I realized was what the unblocking thing needed a manager. I'm blocked on this. Well, I said, okay, if... I had all these directors. I did two things famously. One, I had a lot of direct reports, and two, I did not do any scheduled one-on-ones because you can't have 120 direct reports and do a scheduled one-on-ones because you're never doing anything but one-on-ones.
:
So I said, "I'm going to be around a lot because I don't have a lot of one-on-ones. So we can do unscheduled one-on-ones." And what that means is if you are blocked, actually there's a famous picture where I had this weird cube desk where it was like a circle almost in the middle of the whole floor of engineers. And I was always there because I wasn't in a lot of meetings and people that were blocked, they could just come up to me. Actually, one cool thing about pair programming IRL is you can look across and just see if it's working or not. Because if two people are intensely on the computer, you know it's working. If one person is laying back or you're like, "It's not working," so you can just walk up to-
Farhan Thawar :
It's working if one person is laying back or you're like, it's not working. So you could just walk up to them and be like, "What's happening?" But they would come and ask me questions and I can unlock them. Like, hey, we're blocked on this. We don't have this API. We need money for this machine, whatever. And so the unscheduled one-on-ones ended up being a real clarifying thing for me. Because I did scheduled one-on-ones my whole career and I realized after leaving Microsoft for three years, I'm like, where are all those one-on-ones useful once a week for three years, right? A hundred and fifty one-on-ones.
:
So the unscheduled ones were, though. I was like, when I knocked on my manager's door and said, "I have this problem, those were important." So that's what I created at Xtreme. And the 120 directors, it just grew over time. I just didn't think I needed managers. So I was like, let me unblock these people on another way. And we came up with other things to systems to unblock them that didn't require a manager. And I just also had a good memory. I knew exactly everyone's skills and compensation. I knew all that off the top of my head, so that helps.
:
The thing that I broke was actually, this is Chamath. He came in and became our biggest investors. He's obviously is a smart guy, but he said the right thing, which is not, this can never work, because then I would go into defense mode and explain to him why it would work. He just said to me, I'm not going to debate with you whether this works or not, but will it work at 400 people? And I said, probably not. He said, okay, so let's change it.
:
And so we did then ended up putting a little bit more of a structure, but I made a few people directors and I forced them to have 40 direct reports each. I said, we're just going to make it still pretty flat. And then that did end up working, because it still allowed them to use the system to unblock people versus having to do a one-on-one every week, or having to talk about things that potentially a system could unblock. And so I tried to figure out ways to systematize things.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love it. Just another example of doing things differently, not necessarily just, here's how it's done and I'm going to do it that way and experimenting with it. Even if you knew, okay, maybe long term this isn't the way it's going to operate. I imagine at Shopify you don't have 120 reports.
Farhan Thawar :
No, we have fourteen or something. We do have these guardrails where I think we say, Hey, in engineering you should have between eight and 20. There are definitely people who have more and people who have less. But we do try to keep things as flat as possible, because we do believe that it doesn't make sense to have three people reporting to and then to somebody, and then they only have three people. You just make a very deep hierarchy. We actually do see, by the way, the farther you are from Toby, we can see things in the survey results. The alignment gets out of whack, and so you do actually see that you want to be closer, you want to have a flatter org in general, and that can be achieved by just having more direct reports per level.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Makes sense. Okay, final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. We have this recurring segments that I call Fail Corner where generally people come on these podcasts, they share all their successes. Here's all the things that I've done, right. Here's all the big wins. And everyone feels like, oh man, I wish I was always successful people. When in reality, everyone that comes on has failed many times. Is there a story of a failure in your career that you could share that helps people see that even folks like you fail, and maybe what you learned from that experience?
Farhan Thawar :
I have a few. I'll say one thing by the way, because I think I read this in Tim Ferriss's book or in the podcast where he said, create a failure resume and write everything down. And I would not recommend doing this because I did this and I got super... I'm like a high energy happy guy. I wrote down, I have a note on my phone called Failure Resume, and I wrote down all the times I failed and it is depressing. So I would not encourage people to do that, but I'm happy to tell you about a few instances.
:
So well, one is actually I've been laid off twice and people would not expect like, oh, I'm doing this thing and I've been laid off twice. And I think in both times it was the right thing, it was the right thing for the company, the right thing for me.
:
And I kind of used that experience as a way to reevaluate and eventually came out with my framework of how I want to spend time. But that's maybe a different story.
:
I'll tell you about one at Shopify, the first week that I started, 2019, we were rebuilding our point of sale system, which now does billions of dollars of GMB. But back then we were like, well, let's rebuild it with a new UX and a new technology platform. And it was my first week and I'm the mobile guy, coming from Extreme Labs. They're like, should we build this in React Native, or should we build this natively on the mobile platforms? And so I went through this evaluation, spent a lot of time, blah, blah, blah, and I came back with a hedged solution, which is kind of dumb. I said, let's do iOS and Swift and let's do Android in React Native. And the reason I said that was I said, I want to learn about React Native and I think Android's the harder platform, so let's build that in React Native, but iOS on Swift because that guarantees us a product in market. And we didn't have any React Native apps in market at the time. A year later we launched the iOS version and it was a huge success. And we then spent another six months building the React Native version for Android and everything else. And we realized pretty quickly that React Native was the platform for the future. We were like, oh my God, this will allow us to have one platform. You could run it on the web as well, and we could use the React engineers from the web to work on it. It was a clear winner. By then, we had also launched a shop app, which is React Native.

And so we learned a lot about this. And I went back and I said, hey everybody, I made a huge mistake. We just spent a year building this thing. It's in market, but we're going to have to rewrite. We're going to have to rebase back onto this iOS version. And I think I burned 18 months of time with a hundred engineers, literally from the decision I made in the first week of joining Shopify, and Toby, when I went to Toby and I told him, I go, hey man, I think I made this mistake and we have to do this and it's going to cost us a hundred engineers, another six, whatever. And he looked at me and he goes, you should tell everyone this story. That's all he said. Not like, hey, bad, good. He goes, did you learn something? It was an epiphany for me, but he was like, this is a learning org, and I totally failed and I told everyone I failed and my mistake and everything else, but he goes, just tell everyone because he goes, do you know what mistake you made?
:
And first I was like, I don't think, like, what mistake. He's like, you didn't take. He goes, I will always come down harshly on people who do not take risks, and you did not take a risk in this case. But if you take a risk and it doesn't work out, you'll never get in trouble, because you took the risk and it was the right risk to take, but he goes, but you didn't take the risk.
:
And so what I should have done, and by the way, even now thinking back it would be super hard to do, first week at Shopify, right, is take a risk on a platform that we have not launched in production app on, but he was correct in that we should have, because we would've saved ourselves so much more time. So yeah, total failure, sorry. The product is super successful now and we're all on React Native and even the Shop Green app is on React Native. Everything's React Native, and we're core contributors. It's all good. But I literally burned I think 18 months of time for a hundred engineers as my first decision in the company.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This might be the best example of failure coordinator we've had yet. This is a great example. Both of them actually are, although I'm wondering, okay, that felt like a really good decision to me and it's-
Farhan Thawar :
It sounds like it, right? But It wouldn't have been his.
Lenny Rachitsky :
But it's, obviously you don't want to just take risks. There's a limit of a risk but informed, I guess. Is there anything you missed there that would told you this was the right path? Because in hindsight, of course we should have done this, but looking back, what do you think you should have done other than we should have done the risky path?
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, I mean one thing about my career as well is I don't really do anything halfway. And when I started looking into React Native, it was never just that I'm going, oh, let me look at the docs and read and build a thing. It's like I flew to Meta and met with the React team. I became a core contributor. I ran the React Native working group, like we became release captains for React Native. I knew that I was going to do all the things, so I'm like, and of course in React Native you can also drop down to native and do things there that are not possible. So I think I hedged incorrectly. I knew I was going to do all these things and I should have looked at my own thought process, say, if I do all the things, can I fail? And I didn't take that into account because again, I did five or six.
:
I literally, I put everyone together. I was running the group, I was like release captain. I would hang out with the React team and Meta, we're doing all the things. We became core contributors at React Native before we became core contributors and react because of all the things I was doing. And so I think just knowing that I was going to go all out, I should have said, you know what? This is not going to fail. And I didn't have the confidence in that path, so I hedged, right? Hedging is the worst. And I remember the CTO at the time said, I'm wondering if I should force you to go React Native. He literally said that. And I said, I will do if you say that, I will do it, but it would've been his decision. And so he didn't do it. He didn't tell me to do it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, that makes a lot more sense. It's so funny that Facebook had a similar mistake early on in their career-
Farhan Thawar :
HTML5.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, exactly. I know. I don't know if you were at Zuck's interview at the Chase center that the Acquired podcast did, and he talked about this where their market cap dropped 80%. They were about to go public. They went with this app. No one thought they could do mobile ads. And he's like, that set us back a year and a half. He's like, but based on all the pain he's gone through back since then, he's like, that was not too bad.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, it's true actually, maybe what people don't know is, I was at Facebook, XtremeLabs, worked on the Facebook app and we worked on that app. I was in the office when we submitted the iOS app every single day that week, because it kept crashing. And we had obviously direct access to people at Apple, but we'd ship a new app on Monday and it crashed ship an app on... Not just us, but us, Facebook together. And so I remember that whole HTML five fiasco from the inside.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I thought you would say you also told Facebook to decide on the HTML5 app to set them back a year.
Farhan Thawar :
I did not. We happened to be there when they were doing it. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's so funny. Amazing. Thank you for sharing that. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think would be valuable to leave listeners with, either touch on something you've mentioned, a last piece of nugget of wisdom, or we just go straight to the round?
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, I'll say something maybe embarrassing for you. I've been using your performance management framework from your first round review article, not knowing by the way that it was you. I actually found it, you being the famous Lenny podcaster, but the old days, maybe the Lenny, the PM. And I remember reading this a long time ago and just copying, there's a Google link in there to a Google Doc link with a template for a performance review framework that I've been using for years.
:
Literally every review I've done at Shopify uses that framework. And I was writing a post to my admin about how we can use LLMs to make it easier for me to write these reviews, even though obviously you have to read it all and go through it, but I was like, how can I generate some of this with an LLM? And so I wanted to send her the original article. So I went back to the first round review, I found the article and said, oh my God, it's Lenny, the same guy.
:
So I will say one thing that's interesting about that framework is, I've used it now for, like I said, six years here, is that, and I don't think it's me. I think it's actually the framework pulls out good information. I've had multiple people in a review process tell me that, when I deliver the feedback in, of course the format, they would say, wow, I've been in industry a long time. This is the best performance review I've ever had. And it's because the framework pulls out good information. So congrats to you.
:
But I think it was funny that randomly I was coming on this podcast and I just wrote that doc to my admin two, three weeks ago and realized it's the same person.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Well, how about that? I love that. I'll also give credit to a four board guest on this podcast, Vlad Loktev, who was my manager at Airbnb, and that's where I was inspired to write about that framework.
Farhan Thawar :
Amazing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So it trickles down to him and I don't know where he boarded this, he probably invented it. So credit to Vlad also for that. Another fun fact along these lines, I have another first round of repost about the W framework, which is a framework for planning. They do annual planning. And that's one that I've slowly discovered many, many companies use and they don't know where it came from. They just call it, oh, we have this W framework. Someone flipped it and call the M framework. But that's another one that has trickled into the ether of tech companies, which is awesome.
Farhan Thawar :
Amazing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
With that, Farhan, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Farhan Thawar :
I'm ready.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's do this. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?
Farhan Thawar :
There's one. So Toby has an annoyingly long set of books that he recommends, and they're all, not all, they're usually good, depends because we're not totally in sync on fiction, for example. But he recommended one to me that I think everyone should read right now called Manna, M-A-N-N-A, from Marshall Brain. It is a book, it's a book about AI. And I think the most interesting thing about it though is about a future in which the AI tells the humans what to do. So it's this idea of, imagine in the future you came into work and the AI would tell you what emails to pay attention to or what dashboard to look at because something weird is going on. It takes that to an interesting level. So I would recommend reading that book. It's not long. That's fun.
:
I think another book that I recommend to people, and it's a weird one to recommend, but it's Business Adventures from John Brooks, the famous, if you ask, I think it's Bill Gates, what his famous book of all time is, it's this book.
:
And the cool thing about the book is that it is not easy to digest for anyone with focus problems. Paul Graham wrote the post How to Do Great Work, and it's super long. The best part about that post is that you have to be able to read the whole thing. And so the same thing with Business Adventures. I think each chapter is, it's 12 chapters, 12 stories, no breaks in between. It's just each one is super long. But it just goes into a problem at such depth that if you can maintain your focus to get through the depths of each problem, you will just learn something, just like that post by Paul Graham.
:
I loved that it was so long because I sent it to people and I said, the test here is can you read it? Can you just get to the end? And not in a pejorative way, like in a... If you can get to the end, you will extract the alpha from this post if you can read it all. So those are... Manna is like the opposite. It's very easy and easy read.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm excited to read these. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
Farhan Thawar :
A recent one was Challengers, the tennis movie, with Zendaya just randomly I was at home and I put it on and the cool thing about it was more the cinematography and music. They had this weird style, art house style, where they would be talking and music would get super loud. It was very strange, but a very, very good movie. And then you saw, you said movies and-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Or TV show. Oh, TV show, anything like that.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, one of my all time favorites is probably Halt and Catch Fire. I don't know if you've watched that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
About the early tech industry.
Farhan Thawar :
Early tech. And I think there was an Andreessen podcast where he said this is the closest thing to what a real startup looks like. So Halt and Catch Fire like an all time recommend, everybody has to watch it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?
Farhan Thawar :
I don't know if I want to be in the zeitgeist right now, but the Meta Ray-Bans are amazing. And the biggest thing about the Meta Ray-Bans was just that I think I never got into it and I saw people around me wearing it, but I only got into it when somebody said I'd never take my AirPods with me anymore. And I was like, oh, I can swap two devices for one device. I always have sunglasses and AirPods because I'll go for a walk or listen to a podcast and now I can just have one device.
:
And this happened to me. I was in the summer, I was at a pool party and someone called me and I just took it from my sunglasses and people were confused as where I was taking this call from. But they are the right amount of tech. They're in unintrusive, you can't tell, they don't look like any tech. And then also I was playing soccer with my kids. I have three kids. I just turned the video on and I was the goalie and they were taking shots and I was watching them. They had no idea that I was just recording. And it was such a cool moment because I was in playing soccer with them. I wasn't with my phone and I got to get this amazing set of video that I would never would've gotten. So I really liked the Meta Ray-Bans.
Lenny Rachitsky :
We had Boz on the podcast who leads a lot of that work and he's got a to teach us. And I put on Ray-Bans while we were doing the interview just for fun. You could see my setup. Okay, cool. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find useful in work or in life?
Farhan Thawar :
Okay, I do. And it's on a lot of my profile bios, and it is, everything you know is wrong. And the reason I like that one, and people always like, what would you put on a billboard? And people always come back to me and say, that's like they know that as my motto.
:
And the reason for that is it's this notion of if all the knowledge you knew was incorrect, could you from first principles build up a view of the world? And that's kind of how I like to think of things is that, anything could be incorrect. Even things that you think are correct, which is why, again, back to the, I like to experiment. I like to look stupid, because I'm always trying shit because I'm like, I don't know if even though you say this is correct, that this is going to work, right.
:
Actually, one example, my wife hates this is I have a Tesla and I routinely will switch gears without fully stopping the car, which you cannot do in a regular car, but I'll be in drive and then I'll slow down to drive back up into my driveway and while it's moving I switch it into reverse.
:
And you never would know that that's possible except for trying. And sometimes it goes beep beep because you're going too fast. And she hates it. But I'm always trying weird things and so that's why I say everything you know is wrong. Who knows what's possible, just try different things.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I do the same thing with my Tesla. I used to do it with a non-electric car and my wife is always like, don't do that. Screwing it up.
Farhan Thawar :
Yes, exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that on an electric car, there's no gear you're breaking, it's just software.
Farhan Thawar :
Exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This quote reminds me of that you shared of everything you know is wrong. The founders of Airbnb always talked about just this point that everything around you was designed somebody, another human. There's not necessarily that much smarter or insightful. It doesn't mean what they did was correct. Somebody else find some better potentially...
Farhan Thawar :
I think Steve Jobs had a similar thing like, hey, you can design anything. Everything's designed by people. I love that one too.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. Final question. So you told me the story of this PhD you hired versus just a guy you met in a college, sorry, in a coffee shop. I read another similar story where you hired a waitress.
Farhan Thawar :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Is that real? Okay, tell that story.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, so again, this is another long list of reasons my wife is in annoyed with me, but this is another one of them. Whenever we are out, I'm always scanning and I'm always scanning people and one, do I know anybody around, whatever. I like to scan for people and I have a good memory for faces. But in this case we were at a restaurant and I saw a waitress doing a very, very good job, an extremely, like she was running between different tables, she was smiling her face, taking everyone's order, making sure that there was a thing happening in the kitchen. She was kind of doing a phenomenal job of organizing the entire crazy busy restaurant. And so in talking to her, I said, what do you do outside of this because you look like you're super. She's like, what do you mean? I'm just the waitress.
:
And I said, well, would you like to, this is XtremeLabs. I Said, would you like to work at XtremeLabs? She's like, what's that? So I explained it to her and I got her contact info. She came into the office and she first started off as our receptionist, so she moved from the retail world into the office world, and then I brought her on as my admin and she became one of my recruiters. And I taught her how to recruit and talked to people and she came in with me to info sessions. And over time we actually hired many more people from the restaurant that were really, really good at their job. And what was amazing was, one, she was organized but not reorganized. I had to teach her at Google Docs and G Suite and everything else, but she was super smart but just never had the opportunity.
:
The coolest thing about this is that she ended up being, she ended up taking over one of the HR functions for us. And she had a college degree and because of the work she had done with us, she was able to parlay that into finishing, doing one more year and getting a university degree. And now she's a director of HR at a company, which is amazing from, like, she went from that environment to this environment and a lot of her people, she pulled the smart and intense people she pulled from that environment also ended up on these amazing career paths. If I see someone doing a good job, I'm like, what do they do? How can I work with them? This is one example of pulling somebody out of that environment. I have lots of other ones where I overhear someone in their designer or an engineer and I try to hire them into my company as well.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. That is such a good story. I love that. Maybe restaurants are the new feeder system for tech companies. Did not think about that.
Farhan Thawar :
Yeah, I mean, everyone's smart at something, so I was trying to figure out, she was really good at this thing. She'd be so good at something else.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. I feel like there's so many stories, more stories to tell, but we're going to wrap it up and let you go, farhan. Two final questions. Where can folks find you a line if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe apply to work at Shopify and how can listeners be useful to you?
Farhan Thawar :
Sure, so Twitter's probably the place I try to hang out the most, X at FNThawar, and maybe I'll put that in the show notes. And then listeners for me. I mean, I love to be challenged. I'm sure that there are people who are like, they heard something that I said and they're like, oh, that's super dumb. We do this instead. Or here's research that says that that won't work. I would love to hear more about these because I'm just again, on a learning journey and if I did something stupid, very likely I would like to learn a better way to do things. So I would love for people to comment and say, hey, this is dumb. You should try this, or, that doesn't make any sense. I would love to learn more. So that's what I'm looking for.
Lenny Rachitsky :
All right, well leave a comment in YouTube or on the Substack post with what Farhan got wrong.
Farhan Thawar :
Amazing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
