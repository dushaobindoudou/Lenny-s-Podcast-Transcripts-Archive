**Okay, I realize this is your first time playing Triple Step. It's kind of mean of me if you [inaudible 01**:

01:09]-
Lenny Rachitsky :
I have to go faster.
Tristan de Montebello :
... Give you six words. So I'm going to give you four words.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. Okay.
Tristan de Montebello :
But here's what I noticed. What I noticed is you were letting the word... The word was the beginning of a new thought. Right, so you say, "Another thing is beers. Another thing is...". So you're finishing your thought and then you're moving on to the next one. Try to hold onto one direction. The one direction is approach your fears head on. And then, so when you see a puzzle, it's like, look, this doesn't have to be a hard puzzle because now I know that if it's scary, I do it. And it's like having kids, which I thought was so scary, I just jumped in and now I'm moving forward. And so it's like I'm growing my beard without caring what other people think just because it might be scary, or maybe I cut my beard because that would be something scary. So you're holding onto the line.
:
With four, it's going to be a little bit easier to integrate them. Ready?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's do it.
Tristan de Montebello :
Social-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Social distancing. It's interesting that social distancing was such a thing that we all had to do for so long. And then all of a sudden we look back at that time we're like, "Was that actually necessary? Did we actually have to stay far from each other? Did that actually have any impact?".
:
There's all these things we have to learn, like sometimes we look at the stock market and we wonder, "Should I be paying attention to the stock market? Should I be distancing myself from it? Should I be investing more often? Should I be reading every newspaper that comes out every day to stay on top of what's happening in the world? Should I get closer to this information or should I distance myself? What's better for me?". And sometimes it feels like you're running this marathon where sometimes you go back and forth. Sometimes it's, "Let's all be together. Let's pay attention to all the news. Let's hang out." And it kind of feels like I just want to just want to go to the toilet and peace out.
Tristan de Montebello :
Amazing. That works. That's really good.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay.
Tristan de Montebello :
That's really good. Well, tell me what, because again, the games are meant to put you in a state of turbulence and find out what was easy, what was hard, what am I noticing? And now you know what you want to work on. If you did a rep and you got it and it went perfectly, then you're learning nothing. A really easy rep is not worth much. The only reps that are worth something are the ones where you feel an edge.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. And by the way, we should say the words right, that I had.
Tristan de Montebello :
Oh, yeah. The first one was the stock market, then a newspaper, which you brought in really, really well, then running a marathon, and then toilet.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah, just the fact that I'm okay doing this is a big milestone for me of just like, ah, whatever. Because before doing this thing I'm like, oh my God, I never want to sit there and come up with a talk for a minute on the most random subject, and there's a lot of power in just feeling comfortable just doing it, just like, sure, let's do it. Whatever. Something will come out that's interesting enough.
Tristan de Montebello :
That's why taking on this journey of speaking is so empowering because speaking is a high performance skill. So taking on a high performance skill, and starting to tackle it, and getting kind of good at it is very addictive. It feels really, really good. If you get good at tennis, if you get good at golf, if you get good at anything, product management, it's a addicting, it's exciting. And as soon as you get good, there's nuance to it, and it's energizing in and of itself. And because we have such awesome hardware as humans, we've been speaking all of our life, a lot of us have a pretty decent level to start out with. So you really quickly, you're getting to like, "Oh, I'm getting some results here. This actually feels good." So there's something really energizing about jumping into it. It's the thinking about doing the exercise that's scary, but as soon as you're in it, it's energizing and empowering.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And also just doing it, this is a very hard exercise. Just giving a made up talk for a minute with words you have to integrate, and concepts. And I think just doing that makes a regular talk so much easier also, because you don't have to do that. So there's something there about just doing it on hard mode, learning things, and then, oh, okay, I just have to talk about a thing that I already know about, that I have planned, much easier. Anything else around this game that is worth sharing before we do our final game?
Tristan de Montebello :
We have a whole series of games, and you could probably even invent other games, but some people will play Triple Step and will say, "Wow, that's so hard." And then they'll go and play Conductor and think, "Wow, this is my game. This is so easy." But other people will play Conductor and think it's impossible, and then come play Triple Step and they'll be like, "Man, this is my jam. I can get this one very, very easy."
:
So again, it's just a mirror of where you're at. And what's beautiful about this is you start playing around with these games, you're very, very quickly going to see, okay, this is my edge. And where your edge is, as you were saying with your quote, is often where the gold lies. So if you can spend some time there and learn what it is underneath the struggle, what's actually holding you back. When you unlock that, whatever's holding you back in Triple Step, or in Conductor, in any other game, is holding you back elsewhere in your life. So when you unlock it there, it kind of unlocks the other things, which is really nice, like a set of gears.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And it's interesting, as we were talking, where my mind keeps going is I just want to say how I didn't feel good about my performance, but I'm internalizing the lesson of don't leak how you feel. And that's a really powerful lesson. It's really hard not to just to be like, "Oh, that was not good." I really wanted to say that after every time I tried this and I am making myself not. And I imagine from your perspective you're like, "No, it's fine. It's like whatever."
Tristan de Montebello :
Yeah, absolutely. I was actually thinking, I bet a lot of people watching you do that would think, wow, I don't think I could do that. That would be their first thought.
:
So absolutely. And again, and this is a habit. And the noise doesn't completely disappear, but it goes down to being almost imperceptible. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to internalize all of these habits to the point where I don't need to consciously think about them.
:
So it's like a gymnast who's doing their tumbling routine and jumps into the air. As they're flipping, they're not consciously trying to think of how to do a flip. They've done it a thousand times. They know how to do a flip. The only thing they have that they may be thinking of, all of their attention is on being completely present to what's happening, relying on your body and your subconscious knowing what to do, is they have kind of like listeners, like in programming, keyboard listeners. You have something that's there that is just listening for anything out of the ordinary. And it's very, very fine-tuned.
:
So as I'm speaking, for example, I might think to myself, "Oh, I may be rambling right now. Maybe I'm going a little bit too long." And it's a little listener that's going to just gently, nicely, say, "Hey, warning, I don't know if you're aware of this." And as I hear that, I might say, "Oh, okay, let me wrap it up." Or maybe it's saying, "I'm not sure if you're being clear," or, "Can you be more precise here?". Whatever it is, it's just a gentle listener in the background.
:
So as you get into the habit of staying in character, and if you had an audience here, we could have asked them right away, "Well, how do you feel about this?". You probably would've gotten really good feedback, really positive, which would've kind of jarred that feeling of, wow, I didn't think I did it that good of a job. And people are saying, "Hey, I thought that was pretty good." So As you get that reinforcing pattern, the voice starts going down more and more.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. I need that voice to go down. That'd be great.
Tristan de Montebello :

**[inaudible 01**:

09:46].
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, let's do another game.
Tristan de Montebello :
Always does.
:
Cool. Let's do last game. Last one of these practical games. So this is actually a game from one of our courses that I'm pulling out. It's not a standalone game, it's one that's inside of the courses. But again, if you wanted to replicate this yourself, you can very easily do it.
:
So what we're going to do here is we're going to work on conviction prompts. So this comes back to this idea of entering a state or changing your energy to impact the words that are coming out of your mouth. So what's going to happen here, is similarly to Triple Step, I'm also going to get a random topic that I just have to start speaking about. But now, instead of getting a word that I have to integrate into my speech naturally, I'm going to get a prompt. So it's going to be the beginning of a sentence that I have to say out loud, and I have to find a way for my brain to just complete the sentence. And the sentences are specifically chosen because they're going to put you in a state of more conviction. So it's going to force me to care more about what I'm saying basically.
:
And this is a game for executive presence. If you think about somebody who you feel has great gravitas or great executive presence, they usually have, there's something about them that's saying, this person really believes in what they're saying. And what this game is showing you is that, hey, there's a way to fast track myself to that place. If I want to have more executive presence, let me bring a little bit more conviction to what I'm saying.
:
There's a caveat, small caveat. Maybe 10% of people in the workforce need the opposite. They need, "Hey, you need to maybe question what you're saying here." But the reality is the vast majority of people actually are not truly standing behind their words and their ideas. And what that does is that the people who speak a lot and feel a lot of conviction, their ideas go through more often than the others. And you'd want ideas to stand for themselves, but that's just not reality. So for most people listening to this, if you can bring more conviction to your words, then your ideas are going to have a better chance of being seen equally to those who are already doing that. So this is what this game's about.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Okay.
Tristan de Montebello :
Okay, here we go. The title is Saying No. I've had to learn this the hard way as an entrepreneur, that saying no is one of the most important things I can do. But saying no is not saying no to a meeting, because that can be easy. And what I'm going to say now matters a ton. This is saying no to doing all of the exciting projects that I want to do. So as I said earlier, I'm Labrador. I get excited about everything, and I genuinely believe that every idea is awesome, but that doesn't mean I can do every idea. I need to choose a very clear focus and stick to that focus.
:
And this is a game changer. When you start reducing the amount of things you're doing to a painful amount, a painful few amount, then when you get there, suddenly everything else changed. And it astonishes me when I do that, just how much more I can get done, even though I'm doing fewer things.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love it. That was great. These words are tough.
Tristan de Montebello :
They were, yeah. This was not an easy one. This was not a... Good thing that I get a tough one. Well deserved.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let me read the phrases real quick, just so folks know. So the phrases you had to integrate is, "This matters a ton. I genuinely believe that every idea is awesome. Game changer."
Tristan de Montebello :
It was just, "I genuinely believe that." Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh, got it. Okay. "I generally believe that." And then, "game changer". And then, "It astonishes me when."
Tristan de Montebello :
And I'm so eager for you to go through this, and for anybody listening to try this for themselves, even if you know what's coming. Like, if you want to do this for yourself right now, write the words, the prompts that Lenny just shared, and choose any title, and just speak for a minute, and see if you can integrate those in. Because you're going to notice how if you bring conviction, these words naturally bring that out of you. And it's so interesting to watch the content change as a result of the state you get into and what you say. So it's really powerful to discover just how incredible your brain is.
:
So same intention for you I think, is choose a strong direction from the beginning. This is always, in speaking in general, the stronger the direction you choose in the beginning, the more ideas you're going to have. Everything gets easier when you choose a strong direction.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, let's try it.
Tristan de Montebello :
But the goal here, is as it says, advocate for an important idea related to the speech title. Ready?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, let's do it.
Tristan de Montebello :
Here we go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
YOLO.
Tristan de Montebello :
The title is Space Exploration.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think it's hard to imagine anything more important to the human race than space exploration. I know there's a lot of talk about people wasting time trying to get us to Mars, or trying to not think about what is happening on earth, but I feel like there's nothing more powerful, and important, and inspiring. In fact, the entire world needs to focus more on the value of space exploration. There's so many things we can discover, so many things that can help us on earth, and we cannot forget how much potential exists outside of our little earth, that we think our whole existence and everything that's ever existed on this one planet, when really we're this tiny, pale blue dot. And it just astonishes me when people don't think about this, don't think it matters, don't think they should spend any time getting us into space, investing money in space. And just hearing stories, if nothing else, of people that have gone into space and how life-changing that was for them, should tell us that space exploration is incredibly powerful and important.
Tristan de Montebello :
Yes, that was awesome. That was so cool. So you had, the title was Space Exploration, and the words were, "in fact", "the entire world", then, "We cannot forget that," then, "It astonishes me when," and finally "life changing". So what was that like? What did it feel like getting...
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, there's a lot of... It really helps, just like, "Here's the thing you're going to believe." And I don't know if I got lucky with stuff, but it just felt like, okay, I have, something comes up that I'm not going to leak. But anyway, it was like, oh yeah, cool, something interesting happens.
:
And that's one of my other actual, just going on a little quick tangent, insights from the lessons that you guys teach, is that as you are forced to talk, you have new insights emerge. And you almost figure out what you think and know by being forced to get out of your head, and these problems help you along that. But I think that's really interesting, of just like, this will help you develop things, and insights, and take them out of your head.
Tristan de Montebello :
Yeah. Well, hopefully we get to talk about the Accordion Method, one of the most powerful methods I have, which is very close to this.
:
But this is often a prompt I tell people when they're speaking. I say, because people tend to get into a public speaking voice, so we'll be in a class, and they'll be chatting normally, and look super normal. And then we'll say, "Okay, now just a timer. I'm just going to give you a speech. Just speak for 60 seconds so we get a baseline." And I click play, and suddenly I say, "The important part about doing this," and they enter into a different version of themselves, a very professional version, whatever that would mean. It's so much more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective to speak conversationally.
:
And so the cue I often give people is don't think about us, just think out loud. And that's really what we're doing. We can, most people have a skill set that's up here and a mindset that's down here. And so if you can just change the mindset to match the skill set, you've already made a giant leap. And you do that by reducing the stakes in your mind and by just speaking. And as you do that, when you're thinking out loud, you have these moments of connecting things in your mind, and then naturally it pops out.
:
And if you're doing it well... And I love, there's a really cool Naval Ravikant interview on the Joe Rogan Podcast from many years ago that's phenomenal. And at one point he talks about communication, if I'm not mistaken. I think it's on that podcast. But he says something along the lines of, "One should discover the words they are saying at the same time their audience is." And this comes back to thinking out loud, like if I'm really in my mind, I'm making connections, and suddenly the words are the consequence of it.
:
So using prompts, poking your brain, giving these cues naturally creates things that you couldn't have anticipated otherwise. It's like putting constraints on a creative project.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that. Before we segue to a couple of these methods, the Accordion Method is one example, I want to ask about, when people hear this, they may feel like you're helping people more, just like make shit up, and why, why would we want that? Talk about just how this isn't just like, you're not going to actually give talks like this necessarily. This is... And I guess I'm answering the question, but I'm curious if that's how you think about it. This is building a skill so that when you actually want to give a real talk that you've prepared, you are better at it. But yeah, just thoughts on just that potential element.
Tristan de Montebello :
Yeah, I think that's an important question, and it's a question I hear a lot because we all know a bullshitter, and that's the person who masters the skill of communication but doesn't have anything to show for it.
:
And so this thing happens, is that I see bullshitter and I think to myself, I really, really don't want to become that person. And what happens is it becomes an immune response or like an immune response where the desire not to be that person and the feeling being around that person gives you is so strong that now if I take even the smallest step in that direction of speaking freely, sharing my thoughts out loud, bringing more conviction or confidence to what I'm saying, not leaking, then there's this immediate response like an immune response in my body that's just too strong, that's saying, "Uh oh, you're becoming the bullshitter. Alarm bells. Alarm bells. Go back to that safe little corner you were in."
:
But the reality is, if you're thinking that, then you have no chance of becoming a bullshitter. Because if that thought is even popping into your mind, then you're the type of person who has developed a very acute skill set of noticing when people bullshit. And you have that same skill set for yourself. So it's just going to be, now it's just too loud.
:
So as we go through this practice, we want to match, "Hey, I want to match that bullshitter's level of communication, except I'm going to have the ideas to back it up. I'm going to really put effort into my craft, but I'm going to be able to show them in the best possible light." And what we want to be able to do is notice, okay, if this is a big thing for you, the bullshitting, and you're noticing a big reaction, just even listening to us, not even playing the games yourself, then you definitely benefit from calming that voice down. So spending time learning these skill sets, because you're most likely atrophied because you're staying away from it. And you're going to have this very powerful listener in the back of your mind that's going to ping you, and it's like, "Hey, you're at the limit right now. Stay true to what you know." And it's going to be a very good compass for yourself. It's going to be there and you can trust it because you developed this capacity.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. That's really helpful.
:
Okay. So, so far we've shared a bunch of techniques, things that you could just start doing today. We've done all these fun games that you could play online. If nothing else, just learning from the techniques these games teach you I think is really helpful. You've shared a bunch of principles of just like, here's how you actually get better at public speaking, and not this way, but that way.
:
I know you have a couple also methods just like that people can implement that helps them develop talks that I found really helpful. So maybe just as a closing, we talk about these two methods, the Accordion Method, and I think it's the Bow and Arrow Method?
Tristan de Montebello :
Uh-huh.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Let's talk about the Accordion Method. We did this in the class briefly, and it was really helpful, and I've been explaining it to people of just like a really cool way of making your talk better. So talk about how that works and how people might be able to implement it when they're trying to develop the talk.
Tristan de Montebello :
Now, I'm biased when I'm going to say this, so take this with a pinch of salt, but I think the Accordion Method, the Accordion Method might be one of the things I'm the most proud of in my entire life because it's almost revolutionizing the way I think we should prepare speaking.
:
So up until now, we've talked about spontaneous speaking mostly, and that's going to be the vast majority of your speaking. Probably 80% of your speaking is stuff that you can't prepare for. But there are going to be situations where you know you have a deadline and you're going to have to speak. And either you have to speak because it's a job interview, or you're talking to your CEO, or maybe you're presenting to your whole team or an audience of a thousand.
:
The old way I think is shitty. I think it's broken, and I haven't found anything out there that is innovating on this. And it drove us crazy with Michael, and that's what gave birth to the Accordion Method. What's the old way? The old way is I have a talk coming up, so I'm going to dump all of my ideas on a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper. Then I'm going to try rearranging those ideas. And as I'm rearranging the ideas and trying to make them in a talk, I have more inspiration. And I'm thinking, oh, maybe I could say it this way, and I don't want to lose that other thing that I said in the beginning because maybe I would use it.
:
And you start just creating this alien stack of paper with all of your ideas of what your talk might be, and then you're left with 10, 15 pieces of paper. And now as the deadline comes closer, what do you have to do? Well, you have to go through the excruciating pain of turning 10 pages into a script so that you don't forget all of those brilliant lines that you spent so many hours editing. And they're still in writing mode. They're not in your mind.
:
So now that I've created that script that I spent a lot of time editing, now I have to memorize it. And memorization is pretty. We're not good at memorization. Robots are good at memorization, humans are not. And memorization is like a chain where you just have all of these links very linearly. And everybody knows the feeling of going through, reciting a poem as a kid, and suddenly you miss one verse and you're lost, and now you're a deer in the headlights.
:
So what we're doing with the Accordion Method is instead of preparing our talk by writing, we're going to prepare our talk by speaking, and we're going to do so in a very specific way where we're going down the accordion to create extreme clarity, and to understand what the essence of our talk is, and then back up the accordion to bring back in intentionally just the right pieces.
:
So I was thinking of an analogy for this, and one that I really like is imagine you're redecorating your living room. The old way, the writing 10 pages and memorizing it is I'm going to look at my living room and I'm going to rearrange things and put stuff in a corner that I might need later. And then I'm going to bring some new things that I thought could be really nice and I'm going to struggle to make something work.
:
The Accordion Method is saying, and imagine this were easy to do with furniture, I'm going to take everything out of my living room except the most essential pieces that make my living room. So I might be left with that one couch that I really love, a pillow, a beautiful light that I bought three years ago, and one or two other small things. And as I look at that, I'm going to have clarity on the vision I want for my living room. And then very slowly, very intentionally, I'm going to go take certain elements that were already there that I might want to bring back in, and I'm going to bring new elements that now I see make sense. And so by the time you finish with your beautiful living room, it's going to be this beautiful minimalistic room that has a very clear design choice, and every element there is there because you chose it. It's there because you did it very intentionally.
:
So how does that work with the Accordion Method? What we do is you can go through the first step. If you want, you can write all of those ideas on paper just to get them out of your head. That's totally fine. But from this moment on, there's no more script. And I'm just going to give an example of times, but you can change these time constraints slightly. We're going down the accordion by using time constraints. So for example, you would say, "I'm going to speak for three minutes." So you're going to put a timer, and you have two rules. I have to stay in character the whole time and I have to end strong. So you must make it to the end of the three minutes, and it doesn't matter how bad it sounds, how many mistakes you make. The only point here is I'm trying to get my ideas out into spoken word. So I'm starting to populate my mind with everything and seeing where am I actually at.
:
Then after the three minutes, you think of, okay, what did I like, what didn't I like? Then you go to two minutes. And you put a timer and you do two minutes again. And you're very strict with those two minutes, because we're just trying to learn something every time. It doesn't need to be perfect. So at the two-minute mark, you do the same thing, but now you had to shave a whole minute out of that content. And as you do that, well, that means getting rid of the noise, getting rid of anything that doesn't feel right.
:
Then you go down to one minute. And you're going to go down all way to 30 seconds. So you started at a three-minute speech and you make your way down to 30 seconds. By the time you make it to 30 seconds, you're going to have only the essential pieces like that couch and that lamp in the living room. When you have the essential pieces, you're going to have a clear sense of what your talk is about, and it might've changed as you-
Tristan de Montebello :
Sense of what your talk is about and it might've changed as you were going down the accordion. And then from that place on, we're going to do another 30 second rep and then we're going to go back up the accordion. So you do another 30 seconds and then you do one minute, two minute, and all the way back up to three minute. And every step of the way you go from 30 seconds to a minute. Initially, a minute felt hard. Now that's double the time you just had. So you can bring in something that's aligned with the talk you want to share, and then two minutes, same. And then when you get to three minutes, one of my clients once said that it felt like he had a football field in his mind. So much space. And now whatever talk you have left there is a very clear, intentional talk.
:
And not only that, and this is why this is such an incredible method, your talk is now internalized. So you're at the stage of I've written a script that I've painfully edited in the old way that you now still have to memorize and it's a written speech that you're going to have to pretend to give in a spoken way. In this case you're there, but it's already completely internalized, not even memorized. It's internalized. You have these pillars, you know where you're going and by the time you make it through the accordion method, you're basically ready to go give it on stage.
:
But you could give it now in one minutes, two minutes, three minutes, five minutes. It's very plastic. You're going to be able to navigate different time frames. It's not going to really matter if you make a mistake because you're going to have a deep sense of what your speech is. It's not memorized, it's internalized. So not only have you gotten clarity and built out your speech in a very intentional way, but by the time you get to the end of it, you also actually know it and you're ready to perform it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That example of the three minute when you come back up the accordion, that's exactly how it felt when I did this is just like, "Wow, so much time now" because you essentially, the way I think about it is you concentrate it to the best, most important nuggets and then you have time to build on those nuggets and you cut out all the stuff that no one really cares about, which is usually a long introduction, just like now just get to the good stuff and then you expand the good stuff. And it really worked for me and it was a really illuminating experience.
:
For someone that wants to actually use this. Say they have a speech coming up, say they're doing an all hands presentation in a week. Do you do this a week ahead of time? Do you do this a few days before? I guess where do you fit this in the workflow so that you actually remember what you want to say when it comes time?
Tristan de Montebello :
I can't say do it exactly a week or two weeks or it really depends how well familiar you are with the content. If you have an all hands, and this is something that you've been hashing with your executive team over the past two months, you probably know it really, really well and you have a lot of clarity and now it's just about organizing it nicely. So in that case, maybe you want to do a rough go through the accordion a week ahead of time so you have a clear sense of, "What is it that I want my audience to remember and what are the pillars that I know I like to hit that feel really good?"
:
So you can think about these as the foundational pillars that support that one thing that you're sharing or bookmarks that I know I have to hit and then what I would like to do. And so that's what I would write down. I wouldn't write a script. I'd write those down. And then before the all hands, maybe the day before, maybe even the morning of, depending on how important this is or how comfortable you feel, then you might go through just one or two reps of it, but now you already know it, so it should come back very, very quickly in your mind.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And it sounds like it's okay to have some bullet points at the end. It's hard for me to imagine going on stage with a bunch of people watching, not have any slide, bullet point, speaker notes. Any problems just having a couple of the bullet points of core points next to me?
Tristan de Montebello :
Before a talk, I might have four things written down. My one thing, and we'll talk about this in the bow and arrow, my one thing, the one thing I want people to remember and then the three bookmarks or pillars that I want to hit. And these are kind of cues or reminders that are going to send me into that part of the speech. So for example, if I'm talking about the accordion method, like what I just said, if I go back and I think through the pillars of this one. Well, my one thing would be the accordion method is more powerful than memorizing and then doing it the old way.
:
And then my bookmarks might be number one, describe the old way or the old way. Number two, the new way or the accordion method. And then number three might be internalize, don't memorize, and that'll be kind of the takeaway.
:
And if I have that in my mind, if I have 30 seconds, I can say the old way sucks because you have to work so hard and memorize everything and you're memorizing written stuff, the accordion method is much more powerful because you are going to compress it and go down and then open it up and then I'll explain that in a second and then I'll say, so you're internalized not memorized. What I realized right now is actually, it's funny enough though, those were the bookmarks there, so that sent me down that path. But actually I would say bookmark number two is probably the living room analogy. So it would be the old way sucks, the living room analogy, and then describe the accordion method.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's cool. That was an awesome example of just the insights that appear by forcing yourself through this exercise. And it sounds like maybe the best use of this method is if you have a talk all of a sudden short term it's coming, all of a sudden you have to give a talk somewhere. There's a really powerful method to come up with a great talk that's maybe tomorrow, which you didn't expect.
Tristan de Montebello :
When I say I love this, I use this for myself, I use this with every single client I work with regardless of if it's a five-minute talk, a 20-minute keynote, we're using the accordion method, and you can use this at the macro level or at the micro level, so you can use it for the whole talk, but you can also say, "Hey, let's hone in on this part one that you're struggling with or part two and let's use the accordion to get clarity there."
:
So you can use the accordion as almost like a brainstorming way. I just want to see where I end up here and it takes maybe 15 minutes or something to go through a full accordion. It depends the time constraints you give yourself. Sometimes I'll just do two minute, one minute 30 seconds, that's even shorter, but I'll go through it for one piece of the puzzle or it's like, "Hey, we're almost there. Let's really internalize it. Let's clarify this. Let's get it really, really tight." And then I might say, "Okay, now let's do the whole thing through the accordion. So your 20-minute talk, I want to hear it in three minutes." That gets really, really interesting.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Okay. Anything else along the accordion method before we talk about the final technique before we wrap up?
Tristan de Montebello :
We have a full self-paced course on ultra speaking on the accordion. I think it costs like 30 bucks or something like that to access all of the games and all the platforms. A bunch of them are free, but I think this one's behind the paywall. But we also put together a resource where we go all the way, we describe all of the accordion method, the bow and arrow, staying character ending strong on a free email course that we put together. That's ultraspeaking.com/Lenny. So this is shameless self-promotion, but if you want it to go grab it there, you can grab it there and then the bow and arrow is going to tie into the accordion method as well.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. I'm glad you mentioned all that and we'll point people to that URL in the show notes. Okay, final topic is the bow and arrow technique. Let's talk about what that is and how folks can use that to give better talks.
Tristan de Montebello :
The bow and arrow starts with a, it's really a mindset shift that most of us are in the weeds, so we're very sensitive and familiar to all of the content that we're working on. If you're in data, then you have all of the data. If you're sharing ideas, you still have all of the ideas. And the mistake that most people do when they're preparing a talk, a presentation, an all hands a meeting, whatever it is we tend to focus more on what we want to say than what we want our audience to remember. So the mindset shift here is stop focusing as much on what you want to say and focus more on what you want your audience to remember.
:
What we found out is if you think about your last all hands, the last big meeting, the last talk you saw on YouTube or in person, you probably don't remember much. In fact, I wager you might only remember one thing from that talk. And that's what this is all based on. We call it the bow and arrow technique because we think you can only remember one thing out of a talk and that it's very powerful to go through that framework or that kind of thinking when you're building a talk. And the one thing is your arrow. And so when you have that one thing to me I say it's literally a single sentence that is the only sentence people would remember if they left your talk. Would you be satisfied with that sentence?
:
It takes some times to get to a good one, but if you have a good one, it unlocks everything. It's like you're having a north star or a compass in your pocket. You can always pull it out. You always know where you're going. It gives you a lot of clarity. It's also giving a lot of clarity to your audience obviously.
:
But you can't just throw an arrow at somebody's face. You need to notch it in the bow and pull the bow back. And so to pull the bow back, you need to add in weight to that sentence. And that often comes in the form of an interesting anecdote or a data point that's going to support that or a story that's going to add emotion or illustrate it. So you want to find ways in which you can give weight or pull back the bow so that your arrow has that much more impact. So usually the process of clarifying what your arrow is is a back and forth between the bow and the arrows. So if you're going down the accordion method after the first one you might write or before the first one, you might write a tentative arrow, "Here's my one thing", and then the next one you say, "Okay, actually my one thing might be a refined version of that."
:
And so you might rewrite it a little bit and then you might tentatively put in what you think the bow is. "I like the anecdote I used here. I like this data point that I thought was powerful and maybe I can end on this story or this call to action." Then you'll put that in and then you go back in and you give that a try and that's starting to simplify in your mind.
:
And as you go, usually one informs the other. By the time you finish the accordion for example, you should have a very clear arrow and those clear bookmarks, which is the bow. But really the thing to remember with the bow and arrow, if you can only remember one thing, is switch your mindset from what I want to say to what I want people to remember and limit whatever that is you want them to remember as much as possible and that's going to give you extreme clarity.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That is really helpful. I'm preparing my talk for the summit, and so I'm going to use both of these exercises and what I take away from this last piece is as much as you may want to say a lot of things, really all someone's going to remember, as you said is one thing, if anything, but hopefully they remember that one thing.
:
So it's essentially what's the one thing you want people to remember and then what are the pieces of support that will convince them that that's right and that's something that'll stick with them?
Tristan de Montebello :
Exactly. And again, similar to the accordion method, this works in the macro and the micro. So if you have a talk where you're using slides, use it for the whole talk. But then for every single slide, ask yourself what is my one thing? And you might have some support there as well, but if you don't have a one thing for each slide, either the slide shouldn't exist or it should be multiple slides.
:
The symptom of not having a one thing is usually having a slide that says way too many things. I don't know what data point I want you to remember, so I'm going to put all of it on that slide. I'm not sure which piece of information is more important. So I'm going to write down all of my thoughts and I'm going to go through all of them or hope that you go through all of them and extract what you think is interesting. But the reality is people are just going to zone out if you do that. So if you do that slide by slide, you're going to gain incredible clarity and again, you're going to need less preparation and less memorization.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And to build on that, a pro-tip is to make that title of that slide exactly that one thing you want them to take away. Just put it there and tell them exactly what you want them to learn.
Tristan de Montebello :
Yes. I love that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Sweet. Tristan, we've been on a journey. This was a really unique experimental episode. I had a good time even though I did some hard things, you made me do hard things that are good for me. Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Is there anything else you want to leave listeners with or a nugget you want to?
Tristan de Montebello :
I hope people found value. I mean, we did. This was really a group effort and I really appreciate you working on the agenda, really bringing in the games and trying to make this as practical as possible. I think the only thing I want to leave people with is again, this idea of how transformational tackling speaking can be, and the more constrained you feel with your speaking, the more transformational it will be to your life. So I just want to give this encouragement. It's much, much, much more enjoyable than you think it will be. It can actually be exhilarating and energizing and you feel like you can take over the world once you're on this journey. It's beautiful. And so I just encourage everybody, take the first step and start practicing your speaking.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. And I definitely felt that after doing the workshop of just I feel energized, I want to just talk all time, but then I'm like, I need more work. I need more practice. Tristan, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Tristan de Montebello :
Let's do this lightning round. Here we go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?
Tristan de Montebello :
I was given a book by my first coach, Nathan Seward seven years ago called The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks that I've recommended so many times. And it's based on this idea that we tend to self-sabotage ourselves when we experience too much success or too much happiness. And that that's linked to I think five things that would happen to us when we're growing up. One of them is the... What is it, the wild poppy syndrome or something like that. Like the tallest poppy is the one that's cut first. So if you shine in a family of siblings, then anytime you shine too much we're going to say, "Hey, hey, hey, that's not cool for the others." So that's going to be internalized and hardwired in your body and as an adult, as soon as you start shining a little bit too much, you're going to do the same thing to yourself. So the idea is going from having this point above which you can't be happy to turning it into, he calls it an upward-facing spiral with no upper limit. It's a really exciting and empowering book.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
Tristan de Montebello :
I haven't watched much very recently, but I'll say one of my favorite TV shows of all time is the Peaky Blinders, English show with Cillian Murphy. I'm absolutely obsessed with that movie that show. I think it's a true masterpiece. And I've recently rewatched, so I'll qualify this as recent. I recently rewatched The Nice Guys with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, and I think it's just a brilliant comedy. Brilliant. Another masterpiece, I thought.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Do you have a favorite recent product that you have discovered that you really love. Could be an app, it could be something physical.
Tristan de Montebello :
I have a physical product actually right in front of me that was gifted to me by my business partner Michael Gendler, co-founder of Ultraspeaking. This is called an Ember Mug, and this keeps whatever you have in it, warm and it's extraordinary, whether you are a coffee drinker or a tea drinker, you know the feeling of pouring this and sipping it and by the fifth sip, it's cold. This keeps it at whatever temperature you want it to for however long you want. And I absolutely love it. I've been using it basically every day.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I have one of those. I find myself, you could actually control it through the app. You can control the temperature through an app, which I love. I haven't been using mine, but I love the idea. I know a lot of friends love them. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?
Tristan de Montebello :
I think we are too future focused as a species or as a society and as a result, we're always looking for the next thing. So the motto I share with my friends and my business partners and my family the most I think is these are the good old days. And I remind myself, I'll tell you right now for you and for whoever's listening. I mean think about the podcast, it's never going to be this young, it's never going to feel like it feels right now. And it always feels like these things are eternal, but truly one day you're going to look back and you're think, "Man, those were really the good old days." And so I say it right now, enjoy because these are the good old days.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that. And it's so relevant with a young kid, you're always going to think about, "Oh, they're little." I love that. Final question. You were the fastest person to reach the finals of the world championship of public speaking. I imagine that was quite a journey. I'm curious if there's a story from that experience that comes to mind that's like a wild part of that journey or something that might surprise people.
Tristan de Montebello :
Well, the journey lasted almost seven months, and it was the craziest journey of my life. I went into that with no experience whatsoever speaking, so really just a random amateur, and I just climbed the ladder by outworking everybody. The story that came to mind right away was six days before the semifinals. So I'm six days before the semifinals and I've qualified for the semifinals two and a half months ago. So I'm nobody, now I'm going to the semifinals of the world championships of public speaking. So my mind really is struggling to compute, and I had finally unlocked a speech that I thought was worthy of giving on the final stage. You have to show up there for the semifinals with one speech, and then the next day, if ever you win, you're going to the finals and you have to have a brand new speech, a completely different speech that you're going to give on that stage.
:
So you need two speeches ready to go, and both of those speeches have to be in theory, world-class. I'm six days before. I was struggling at that, really, really struggling to get that speech together. I finally got something and Michael managed to get me. I was flying I think two days later to Vancouver for the semis, and Michael managed to unlock this one opportunity to speak in front of 50 people to give it a try. And so I ran there. I give the speech, and as usual, we film. I film every single speech. I gave more than a hundred speeches over seven months, and I filmed every single speech. And we'd get home, we'd ask everybody for feedback, and I get home and I'm thinking, "Man, something is wrong. Something is wrong." I was so pumped. I wept. I genuinely wept as I wrote the speech because it was so moving. It was all about my life. It was something that I was so connected to. I don't know, probably the emotion of the pressure as well, but that's how much I believed in that speech.
:
We get home, we put the speech on the computer, and as I get to the most important part of the speech, I see two things happen. So this is the moment where I'm expecting people to pull out their tissues. One person pulls up the agenda for the event that they're at and is starting to look at the agenda. Another person pulls out their phone, another person starts going through their purse, and I'm looking at this, and suddenly I realized, "Oh, this speech, nobody cares about this. This is not a good speech. This is terrible." And then I go through all of these feedbacks.
:
I have 50 pieces of feedback, and all I'm getting is, "Good luck for the semi-finals. It's going to go great. I thought it was good", and I'm like, "I'm going to humiliate myself. This is terrible." So I had waves of anxiety. I threw my speech away, and in five days from the ground up, I rebuilt a completely new speech that was basically the best of everything I'd explored, everything I'd experimented with over the course of the three months leading up to that, the jokes that worked the best, like a stand-up comic would. I built my special and I focused on different areas like all of the transitions.
:
And right before the semi-finals, I gave the speech to one person. I was in Vancouver trying to internalize my speech and memorizing it in a plaza where I delimited the size of the stage and I'm just giving my speech out loud to get over the nerves, so I'm ready for the pressure to see if my brain will remember it and everything.
:
Anyways, I gave it in front of one person who was our district director at Toastmasters, and this is a speech meant for 500 to a thousand people, not one person. So I was scared it would flop. But in the middle of the speech, which is a completely different one, I saw a tear roll down her cheek, and then she just hugged me and said, "You got it. You did it. You did it." I walked out on that stage and I made it, and I won the semi-finals with that speech.
:
I think to me, that was really the, it showed me that everything I'd done was worth something, that it actually worked. If I was able to build a speech in five days, that could get me a win at the semi-finals of the world championships. That was kind of the ultimate, "Wow, I won." So when I walked into the finals, to me, I felt like I had already won.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow, that is a story. What an arc. Amazing. I'm so happy you asked that question. Now I just want to watch that speech and I want to learn more about this whole championship of public speaking, which I have no insight into. That could be its own podcast interview.
:
But Tristan, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible. One of the most interesting episodes I've done. Two final questions. Where can folks learn more about Ultraspeaking? I know you built a page where they could experiment with some of this stuff, so share that. And then how can listeners be useful to you?
Tristan de Montebello :
If you go to ultraspeaking. com/Lenny, so ultra like U-L-T-R-A ultraspeaking.com/Lenny, we put together, you have five emails that go deep into a bunch of the things that we've talked here. You can also just go to Ultraspeaking.com where you'll get access to a bunch of the games for free, and you can check out everything else that we do. If you want to follow me or hit me up or ask me questions about this podcast, you can do that on Twitter @Montebello, M-O-N-T-E-B-E-L-L-O. And how can listeners be useful to me? Well, first of all, if you made it to here, then I really appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you for being here with us, and what I would love for you to do is to apply this. We said in the beginning, you can't get better at speaking without speaking, and another piece of that puzzle is you want to do the thing that you're trying to get better at. So if you're nervous speaking in front of people, you want to speak in front of people as part of your practice. So the way you could be useful to me is introduce these games to somebody else. Try them for yourself, practice them with somebody else. Go through the accordion method with a friend. Try conductor, and when you succeed and when you have an awesome experience, then you can tell the world that Ultraspeaking helped you do that, and that would be huge.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Tristan, thank you so much for being here.
Tristan de Montebello :
Thanks, Lenny. It was an honor.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It was my honor, Tristan. Bye everyone.
