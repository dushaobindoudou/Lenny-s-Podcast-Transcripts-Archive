**I could see why this works. Can-do attitude plus high standards plus intensity, I could see how that leads to success. There's a lot of talk these days about this 6-9-9 culture, working six days a week, 9**:

00 AM to 9:00 PM. A lot of people are like, "Why? That's terrible. Why would you make people do that?" But at the same time, I'm just constantly hearing this from the most successful AI companies. This is just the way it is to be successful. Things are moving so fast. This is an opportunity you'll never see again. Just talk about your thoughts on that.
Brendan Foody :
Yeah. Well, to clarify, we've never mandated hours. It's more been a byproduct of people that care a lot where we care a lot about the trajectory of the business. And so a lot of people come into the office and stay late. But if they need to leave early and get dinner with their kids or travel on the weekend, of course that's totally fine. And for us, it's much more about finding people who have a lot of ownership and are really bought in, less so about the specific hours in the office, even though we found that oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in, not always, but oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in and that burn the midnight oil with us.
Lenny Rachitsky :
When you say high standards, is there something you could share that gives us an example of what you mean there? Because a lot of people think they have high standards and they don't.
Brendan Foody :
If you are very patient, there's always some trade-off between speed and quality when hiring. And I remember especially for our first 10 people, we were just so patient and disciplined about finding some of the best people in the world. Half of them are... Our second employee, Sid, as an example, our second employee in the US, Sid was previously the head of growth at Scale who joined us when we were a seed stage company. Daniel who joined us was previously scaled to consumer apps to over 100,000 users and all sorts of just extraordinary backgrounds of our first 10 hires. And I think that that initial talent density shaped so much of what the rest of the org looks like as you scale it up.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I know you also have this perspective that people talk about waiting to hire, to hire really slowly, but it's actually not necessarily the right advice. Talk about that.
Brendan Foody :
It's painful because it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, I'm thrilled that our first 10 people are so phenomenal and I think that that has paid dividends for the business. But on the other hand, I think that companies do get to the point where you just need to hire really fast. And there's some things where you need a lot of people to do them and you need to recognize that there's going to be some variants associated with hiring, but moving quickly is the priority.
:
And I think that in some ways, we move too slowly with how we scaled out the team. And so the benefit is that everyone is extraordinary. We have this super high bar and we want to maintain that over time. But I think the downside is that while the company has grown incredibly quickly, we likely could have grown even faster if we had moved a little bit more quickly with especially ramping from call, like 10 to 100 people.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, I was going to ask. So it sounds like the first 10, be very careful, take your time, 10 to 100, maybe speed up a bit.
Brendan Foody :
Yes, though I wouldn't say it's necessarily 10. It's determined by the point where you know it's really working. And I know that's still not a bright line, but it's like once you know that there's so much more demand than you can handle, that's when you want to step on the gas and optimize for speed in a lot of ways. But I think especially until then, it's important to be patient, be disciplined. Get the best people is always important, but speed becomes more important once you find the market opportunity, the market vacuum.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I know you've started a couple companies in the past, much smaller scale. In this new role as CEO of this massive hyper growth company, what surprised you most about where you spend the time most or just what the role involves? Because a lot of people want to start companies dream about being in your shoes. What are they maybe not understanding about where a lot of your time goes?
Brendan Foody :
Yeah, it's actually not too surprising. The top two buckets are always working on hiring and time with customers of how do I really deeply understand what customers need and how we can support them? And then how do I build the team and a lot of the processes around that? Of course, there's all of the ad hoc things I didn't expect of dealing with the people questions of how do we set up our levels and our comp bands and all of that, which you learn as you scale a business. But I think that the core places that I spend my time are in line with what I expected as well as what I love doing, which is very fortunate.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So these two companies you've started in the past, maybe share what they work because they're fun, and then how do they help you be successful in this? What's something that they taught you that helped you in your current role?
Brendan Foody :
Yeah, so there's been like a dozen, but I'll choose my favorite two. So when I was in eighth grade, I started Donut Dynasty where I saw that Safeway Donuts were selling for $5 a dozen, and I was amazed because I felt like as an eighth grader, this was such an incredible deal. And I started to bike down to Safeway, buy Safeway Donuts for $5 a dozen, and then go back to my middle school and then sell them for $2 each, running really good margins of course. It sold out super quickly. And so then I need to scale up. So I would pay my mom $20 to drive me in her minivan down to Safeway, buy 10 dozen donuts, go to my middle school, sell them all out.
:
And then the school tried to shut me down because I was selling food on school campus, which they didn't like. So they had me in the principal's office asking me to not do that. And then I moved my donut stand over 50 feet, so it was off school campus, saying that they could no longer police me. I remember we had competitors pop up where the competitors were charging. They bought these Chuck's Donuts, which if anyone in the Bay Area knows, are higher end donuts than Safeway Donuts, but they have a higher cost basis. They cost a dollar per. And so I dropped my prices to $1 for two weeks to run them out of business before I knew what anti-competitive practices were. And I'd hire all my friends, paying my friends in donuts because they perceived the donuts as $2 each where they could sell them throughout the school and I could have a lower cost basis on them.
:
So I had all of these fun experiences in selling donuts, and then I could talk more about my high school business as well, which was a more significant scale. But I think the takeaway from that was just like you can just do things. So many people have ideas, but the barrier to more companies being built, I think, is just initiative and taking the steps to build the product or experience that customers want and investing the time and the ambition to scale that up. And so I think it was really getting reps of that that enabled me to realize that I should do it later on at a much larger scale.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing story. I love how wholesome that is versus drugs, selling donuts.
Brendan Foody :
Then my mom was very worried. She was like, "Oh, is there any pot of these donuts?" I was like, "No, mom, I assure you these are pure donuts."
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that you paid your mom $20 to drive.
Brendan Foody :
Yeah. She was adamant it couldn't be a handout that she was taking her time to drive me, so she needed to make a little bit of money off of it. We haggled over her title where eventually she wanted to be head of global operations, which we found very entertaining.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I hope that's on her LinkedIn.
Brendan Foody :
Not yet. Maybe she'll have to add it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So you said that you've started a dozen companies?
Brendan Foody :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. Okay.
Brendan Foody :
Well, a dozen projects, but I think it was that, and then my AWS company were the two that I scaled up.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What's the story behind Mercor as the name?
Brendan Foody :
Mercor means marketplace in Latin or to buy, sell, trade. And we want to build the largest marketplace in the world, the marketplace for how everyone finds jobs, and that was really the draw to it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, maybe a last question. This is going back to earlier in discussion because it's something I've been thinking about as we're talking. There's been this shift from data as the fuel for models, and now it's experts. Do you think there's a next step, or is this just will take us to AGI, superintelligence?
Brendan Foody :
I don't think it's necessarily changing from data to experts. It's more just the paradigm of realizing that labs need this close collaboration with experts to help understand what are the evals that they're building and how can they push the frontier. But I think it's very clear that evals are evergreen, that so long as we want to improve models, we'll need experts to create evals for them and to create the post-training data for them to learn those capabilities. And of course there might be changes in the exact way that people do training with RL or otherwise, but they will always need an eval to measure what does success look like across every domain that they want to build.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. So then building on that, a question that comes up a lot these days is, and I know we're talking about fun stuff but I'm getting to serious stuff again, scaling laws and just progression of model intelligence. A lot of people are feeling like, "I don't know, it's slowing down. We're not going to really get to superintelligence at this rate." What is your sense?
Brendan Foody :
I totally agree with that. I know there's been some executives to big labs that say we'll have superintelligence in three years, but I think the truth is that it's a longer road. And that's not to diminish from how extraordinary the models are. I think we'll be able to automate a majority of knowledge work tasks in the next 10 years for sure, but that long road is paved with all of the evals that help to make those capabilities possible. And it's not going to be 10X more pre-training data that gets those capabilities. It's much more going to be all of the post-training data sets that are far more data-efficient and thoughtful that help us get there.
Lenny Rachitsky :
David Sachs tweeted this interesting point that the situation we're now is almost the best case scenario where AI is not in this fast takeoff to superintelligence. There's a lot of competitors keeping each other in check. Models are already very valuable and only getting valuable, more valuable, but there's not just this winner superintelligence taking over the world situation.
Brendan Foody :
Yeah, I think that's true. I think a lot of the super intelligence fearmongering is probably overrated, but at the same time a lot of people's framing around that is even if there is a 5 to 10% chance of this P-Doom, then we should be careful, which seems logical. But I think that it's going to be an extraordinary 10 years for all of Silicon Valley and all of the world as this technology is able to create abundance and giving everyone better medical treatment, the best access to legal recommendations, and the ability to build great products more than we've ever seen before.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And education feels like is transforming.
Brendan Foody :
Absolutely, right. I even have felt bits of this over the last 10 years where I remember ever... My parents would give me a hard time for not going to classes in college and I'd be like, well, there's way better lectures on YouTube. Why not just listen there? But I can only imagine as the models get extremely good at conveying information, better than the best professor, what that'll mean and access to all sorts of information to better forward humanity and upskill everyone.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So I'll use that as a segue to a final question. I'm going to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on the podcast. What's some way that you personally use AI to do better work to help you in life?
Brendan Foody :
Well, let's see. I use it a lot to write documents, as you would expect. I also talk to get advice on problems. I find it helpful to just reason through almost as a thought partner because, yeah, I don't know. I find I think better sometimes when I'm talking something through, but I can't talk through everything with colleagues or people around me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And so this is like ChatGPT Voice Mode mostly or something else.
Brendan Foody :
Yeah, I like ChatGPT Voice Mode a lot. There's stuff-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Me too.
Brendan Foody :
... or room for improvement, but I am very excited about the future of Voice.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let me show you something I built, actually. I wasn't planning to talk about this, but there's this guy, Eric Antonow, who's been recommended by a lot of people to get him on this podcast. He's this creative product person that's under the radar now. He's at Facebook for a long time. He built this project called Pirate GPT, which is you basically put ChatGPT into a stuffed animal to talk to it. So built a little wise owl. I don't have it on right now.
Brendan Foody :
Wow.
Lenny Rachitsky :
But basically you sew in a little speaker right here and you put a little magnet underneath and you can put it on your shoulder and then you just talk to it.
Brendan Foody :
That's so cute. Wow. I love it. I'll have to get one of those. Because I have some of the voice assistants in my apartment, but I really want a ChatGPT voice assistant, so I'm excited for-
Lenny Rachitsky :
I was just thinking that. Yeah, just come on. Why can't we have a ChatGPT voice just sitting around listening to us all the time. And you can't on your phone because it goes to sleep and it's like, "Hello, what?"
Brendan Foody :
Exactly. Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, so it's what this is trying to be. Well, there's a kickstarter he started that we'll link to that. You could help out.
Brendan Foody :
There we go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's really easy.
:
Brendan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on or maybe leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lighting round?
Brendan Foody :
Tying to the point around initiative and that you can just do things, I encourage everyone, especially with AI and it being so much easier to build, just take the initiative to go out and build products and talk with customers and take that leap of faith because I think that that is in so many ways, the largest barrier to more innovation, the economy in any way that we can support that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. There's so many people that just, let's not bash the podcast, but just listen to podcasts, read posts, just keep reading and listening and don't do anything with that information. And there's never been an easier time to actually build stuff and try stuff.
Brendan Foody :
Totally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So definitely take that advice. Just you can do things. You can move your donut stand 50 feet and get out of their jurisdiction.
Brendan Foody :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, Brendan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?
Brendan Foody :
All set.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
Brendan Foody :
Let's see. I would say in order, High Output Management is a phenomenal book on running companies. Second is Zero to One, which of course is a classic. And then third is Shoe Dog, where I just find it to be a really inspirational story.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What is a recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
Brendan Foody :
I really liked Oppenheimer. My favorite TV show of all time is Suits, so I know not recent, but if I had to choose a recent one, probably Oppenheimer.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Very cool. Suits, first time someone's mentioned that. Favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?
Brendan Foody :
I love using Codex, like the new version. I know it's sort of new in terms of version. Yeah, I think it's incredible and just a huge, huge improvement. So yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Do you have a life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with folks, finding useful in work or in life?
Brendan Foody :
I think it's you can just do stuff, what we were talking about earlier. Take the leap of faith.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I thought you were going to say can do, which is in your Twitter profile.
Brendan Foody :
Can do as well, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Two great ones. Final question. So we were chatting before this about things that we could talk about and you shared this interesting thing that you haven't shared anywhere else, which is that you're dyslexic. Why don't you share that with folks? And just how do you get around that having built the fastest-growing company in history?
Brendan Foody :
I don't hide it at all. I think a lot of my colleagues know. And I think on one hand it definitely makes it difficult to go through 1,000 emails a day or read every document that I'm supposed to, but on the other hand, I feel like it helps me to think a little bit differently, to be more creative, and perhaps see that markets are changing that not everyone sees. And so it's turned out okay so far. And so I think one thing it's helped me realize from a management standpoint is that we focus much more on how we can leverage people's strengths rather than helping to improve weaknesses, because there's some things that I'm not great at and I'll never be the best in the world at, and there's others that I can hopefully refine and strive to be.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's such a also recurring theme on this podcast of just focusing on strengths and not focusing over all your focus on weaknesses.
:
Brendan, this was incredible. I learned so much. I have a billion more questions, but you got shit to do. Two final questions. What should people know about what you're doing and roles you're hiring for? And then how can listeners be useful to you?
Brendan Foody :
Absolutely. We're hiring a ton across the board on our team. We're hiring strategic project leads on our operations team, software engineers in our engineering team, as well as researchers. And so please go to mercor.com and we would love to work with you, and that's the largest way that you can help us. Share it with your friends as well. Over half of people in our marketplace come from referrals because we have a platform of people that love us. And so any jobs that you want to apply to or send your friends to, we would love to have you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Brendan, thank you so much for joining me.
Brendan Foody :
Thank you for having me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
