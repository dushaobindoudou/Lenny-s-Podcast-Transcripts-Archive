## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### Highly recommend anybody looking into. My next favorite growth framework's actually written by you, Lenny, and Dan, which is a race car framework. Everybody has a really hard time often thinking about what are all of them parts of growth initiatives and which are long-term, short-term, how much are they going to actually produce in results? And race car framework is wonderful because it separates different initiatives into, hey, there's some engines, loops that are just going to keep on spinning. There's some fuel that you're going to need to add into it, potentially like paid marketing dollars. There are some turbo boosts that you may have in your race car that are going to be, let's say big user conferences that you're going to hold as a product or there's [inaudible 01

17:22] and optimizations that you're going to need to do pouring oil into that engine so that actually performs correctly. It's beautiful. I talk about it all the time with everybody.
:
The next favorite growth framework for me comes from Bengali and that's adjacent to user theory. I think that was very powerful in terms of thinking about growth evolution. And as we talked about adding different growth models to your growth ecosystem, different growth loops, but also adjacent users which are out...

### Cool. On that last one, [inaudible 01

18:11] Bengali was on the podcast. We'll link to that episode if you want to go deeper on the adjacent using user theory. I love how that was a few minutes on things that could change people's life if they adopt one of these frameworks and learn how to think about growth in this way. It's such a powerful mental model for thinking about all this stuff you've been talking about this entire conversation.
Elena Verna :
Yes, those frameworks are like my church in my mind of my system of beliefs of ho...

### But my favorite meme is actually one of the first ones that I've created and I think it's from Family Guy where they have an elephant and the penguin standing and then there's Moses I think, or some biblical character saying, "What the hell is this?" Looking at the elephant and the penguin. And the result of it is a child that has a penguin body and an elephant head. And if you think about elephant as product and penguin as marketing, what the hell is this is gross. Which is a byproduct, a weird, weird byproduct, product and marketing merged together that doesn't really fit with either, yet it's its own entity. I don't know. I think that that's the best to describe to people what [inaudible 01

33:14] is.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So appropriate. Also, it's hard to describe a meme and make it feel funny. So good job. Thank you for doing that. We'll link to this meme in our show notes. Elena, this was incredible. Thank you again. Thank you for being our first ever third return guest. Hopefully there will be many more episodes of Elena Verna. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?

## Full Conversation | 完整对话

*Below is the complete transcript of the conversation.*

*以下是完整对话记录。*

**And this is why I also started doing a lot more of my own, almost, prototypes, like skeletons of here's the elements that you should do in these flows. I have one for pricing page, I have one for homepage, but you need to put in your own [inaudible 00**:

32:36] into it, in order for it to actually work.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What made me realize this back in the day was thinking at Airbnb, especially, thinking about people looking at our flow and being like, they've got it all figured out. We're just going to copy what they've done, so thoughtful and have tested everything. And knowing how that has not happened and how so much of this was guesswork and we hate so much of it. Just thinking about people trying to copy this thinking we know what we're doing. It's like, "What are you guys even thinking?"
Elena Verna :
Oh my God, I actually had that happen to me. At Dropbox not so long ago, somebody reached out and they're like, "Oh, I looked." It was like some page on activation flow and they're like, "Oh, I love this page. This is so cool. I love what you've done here. I'm going to go take it to my company." I'm like, "We haven't touched it in 10 years. This page is only visible for small cohort of people. Please don't do it. Please don't copy it. It performs like shit. I know it's out there, but it's not meant to be out there. Nobody thoughtfully put it out there." So that's definitely a huge failure point that you can run into.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Right, if it's like a fancy company, assume they're just so smart and diligent about every little pixel and decision.
Elena Verna :
If people only knew of how much craziness is happening in those big companies and how much chaos there is.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh man, that's a whole other podcast episode.
Elena Verna :
Whole other podcasts, yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, number five.
Elena Verna :
Okay, I have this one. It's a little bit Meta, but I see it happening all the time. We love to think that our problems are unique. I'm working in this company and we have this gross problem and we need to go and figure out the solution from the grounds up. Maybe this is a little bit related to the competition point, but I'm very sorry to break it to all of you, but your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that. Your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere in probably many, many places and you trying to re-engineer solution is time lost to market and has a huge opportunity cost.
:
So my biggest thing that I try to get people is don't think that you have unique problems. You don't. I know we love to. It'd be fun to have something unique to learn, but with so many startups, with so many people in our industry, in your industry, whichever industry that is, your problem has been solved by somebody. Or at least that there's a lot of failures on the problem that you should be learning from. And number one thing that whenever you have an initiative or whenever you have a metric that you need to go and move, to not start from scratch, ever. Do not start from scratch. It's the worst thing that you can do because you can waste so many cycles on trying to do something that probably has already been solved, which means how do you approach this as a result?
:
Well, you can look at competition and how they're solving the problem. That's one input, for sure. You should go find people that have solved this problem because there are people there and people love to talk about what they do. So take advantage of that human psychology and go find those people and just ask them, "How did you do it? What did you do? What happened?" Obviously, not all the time everybody's going to respond, but we have LinkedIn, we have X. Go out there, find the people that you think or ask around in your network of who you think might have similar solutions and just go talk to people. It would be incredible shortcut if you're talking about an actual hack that is a hack to get to an optimal solution.
:
And then the last thing that I would also say is that solving any one problem uniquely is extremely inefficient. We are evolving so fast in our market, you need to be able to patternize your solutions. Patternize, is that a word?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's make it a word.
Elena Verna :
Make patterns. Make patterns out of your solutions. So more you can stop looking at as a unique data point or unique problem and more as there is, I need to fit it into existing pattern or I need to figure out the framework on how to solve not only this problem but other problems. The faster you'll be able to get at least to like 60% of the solution there. And then you can do very authentic implementation of whatever you want to do. But to go from zero to 60 manually, as a one-off, we do not have time in the industry right now to do it, unless you want to be left behind.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bam. Powerful words. Is there an example that comes to mind of you doing this either the wrong way of just thinking this was unique and realizing I should have talked to people, or where you actually realized something was not unique?
Elena Verna :
I'll give you actually an example that I had when I was at Nero. At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community, and I was tasked to do it, and I've never done it before. So I was banging my head around against the wall and I'm like, "Okay, how do I do it? What software do we use? Where do we acquire users? What kind of content is going to go in there?"
:
So I was approaching it almost like a finding product market fit, and I will fail so much doing it. And I honestly only have a year to get to some sort of traction before this is going to get shut down because company is impatient, company is moving fast. So if this is going to be a failure point, it's either going to be taken away from me, which is fair, or we is going to close the door on it, which would be a huge failure both on my point and for company as a whole.
:
So I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities, and I remember talking to Caroline from Atlassian who has stood up community. I actually hired her as an advisor afterwards and she's like, "Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?" And I'm like, my mind was blown. I'm like, "I even considering all of these angles because I was just literally thinking about users only." And she's like, "Well, you shouldn't necessarily start with the user community. If you want some results out of it, go to agency or partner communities first." She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results at the end that I wouldn't even gotten to probably until six, eight months later, if I didn't talk to her.
:
So I think it has to come with a place of knowing that you don't know everything and humility to say, "Hey, I need help," and I might have a already fancy title. At that point, I was an interim CMO at Nero and I'm like, "I don't know how to do this." And it actually earns you a lot more credit than you think. And a lot of people are afraid to admit that they don't know how to solve a problem and that's why they start from scratch. But you need to really put your ego aside and get some help faster than trying to hit every single failure point along the way.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And the thing that'll really hurt your ego is failing. And so the more you could do to avoid failing and being successful with this initiative by talking to people, doing research.
Elena Verna :
And to be fair, failure is going to be unavoidable. If you talk about growth, growth is about failure. My big motto, life motto on growth is that you have to fail to learn. You can't just constantly succeed. Success is an output of a lot of failures, but the question is, how much time do you have to fail? And a lot of times we don't realize how many failure cycles we're going to have to go through before we get a success, and that company, or even market, has no time for that. So still expect to fail, sure, but the timeline for failures is going to be shortened quite a bit.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, so we've gone halfway through your list. There's 10 items on this list, right?
Elena Verna :
Yes, yes. There's 10 items. Next one is a good one.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.
Christina Gilbert :
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.
Christina Gilbert :
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I can tell you that if team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever?
Christina Gilbert :
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.
:
Let me summarize the first five real quick and then we'll keep going. So the first is, wait longer than you think to hire a head of growth. Wait until you have product market fit, maybe a million, or especially if you're self-serve oriented.
:
Number two is if your growth is declining, the head of growth won't solve that problem. First, stop the decline at least. Third is redesigning your homepage, marketing page. Rebranding is not only not going to help you grow, it's going to probably hurt growth and slow things down. And so just go into that wide eyes wide open.
:
Four is don't just copy the competition and assume they know what they're doing and assume that what they do is going to work for you. Use it as inspiration. On the other hand, look at get inspiration from experts, competition, trends, things like that to help you solve your problem, which you think is no one solved before. It turns out every problem you're solving someone has solved in some way, most likely.
Elena Verna :
Yes, especially in growth. I mean, I know this can apply to a lot of product management and to marketing as well, but in growth, when you're talking about how do I lift activation or have a really big drop off between activation and monetization? These things are a lot more patternized than you would expect them to be, so go and find those patterns as opposed to trying to re-engineer it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Okay, let's keep going. Number six.
Elena Verna :
So next one. Next one is a little spicy one too, and that is part of growth you owning some channels. A lot of growth teams own acquisition. So owning channels and growth prioritizing SEO, SEM, social, is one of the biggest mistakes I think a growth team can do. Now, obviously, I'm not saying don't do SEO, or don't do SEM, so organic search or paid search. I'm not saying that. However, as a growth team, your number one priority is to create your own or your earned channel. So channel that you've earned and that nobody else can compete in but you.
:
What do I mean by that? When you're doing organic search or paid search, you're making Google richer. Great for Google. Google is an incredible company, but by dumping money into paid marketing, you are paying them and you're paying for their distribution and access to their distribution. If you're doing social too, like you're doing, let's say, Instagram or whatnot, paid advertising in Instagram, that's great, but all of that works on algorithm. An algorithm can giveth, but algorithm can also taketh away at any point. And you have no control because you don't own those channels. You are playing with other players and you're competing against them in somebody else's channel.
:
Now, on the other side, there can be your own earned channel. What is earned channel? It really goes into the concept of product-led growth acquisition, which means you're relying on virality, on word of mouth, on user-generated content in order to attract new acquisition through top of the funnel. So why is that earned and why do I put that above, let's say organic search, which is SEO, obviously, is wonderful? But again, search just goes to Google. That's great. Versus if you build your own user-generated content in your own community, nobody else can compete with you in that. That is yours. Your competitors cannot buy their eyeballs. Their people are going to be attracting other people.
:
Referrals from people to people are everything. So, Lenny, if I, let's say I sign up for, say, Superhuman and I invite you into it. That is much stronger acquisition tactic versus you looking for and finding Superhuman, let's say on paid marketing advertisements. And especially with our age right now where search as an interface is changing towards AI interface and the AI interface is giving a lot less credit to all of the content. Content is almost becoming a database and there's a new UI that is being developed on it. Before it was Google was the UI, and now AI is coming in with a new UI, and there's not as much control that you have over this new UI that is being developed.
:
Focusing on these earned channels that you own becomes the outmost priority. And if you don't have them on your growth roadmap, you are going to be in some really big trouble over the next year to two years because your cost of acquisition is only going to go up. Your competition and those channel is only going to go up. You're constantly going to be praying to algorithm Gods to giveth your way, but again, they can taketh at any point. And it's really one of those fundamental growth team failure points if they don't spend enough time on virality and user generated content to create their own earned acquisition.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. Okay. This is incredible. This is its own podcast episode in theory that we could do of how to actually do this. We're not going to cover the strategy. Also, this may not necessarily work for every company. Your point is, you can grow other ways, but this is by far ...
Lenny Rachitsky :
Your point is you can grow other ways, but this is by far the most powerful, most effective, cheapest, most likely to succeed. If you can figure this out.
Elena Verna :
It's not cheapest. It's actually cost a lot of product and engineering and even marketing resources to stand up. So it's not the cost of a budget, but it's cost of people that will have to work to create your own channel, so to speak, for acquisition. And you're right, maybe that's not for everybody, but it's actually applicable to more products than people realize. Because, every single product has some sort of team functionality, some sort of roles that they need to do. Every product can drive word of mouth loop... Well, actually, that's not true. Not every product can drive word of mouth loop, but they can drive recommendations and they can create user generated content.
:
One of those tactics usually applies to at least one product. So there is an opportunity to create some sort of earned channel, even though it might feel unnatural at the beginning depending on how you reach PMF and how you've scaled in the first couple of stages of it. But if you are not exploring it and if you are not investing into it or at least trying and failing within it, I think that you are really leaving too much of your growth future into the hands of somebody else that you have low control over.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So the advice here is your growth team. It's okay if they work on SEM, pay growth basically and SEO, but most of your effort and investment should be in earned channel, owned channels, specifically virality generated content?
Elena Verna :
Diversify. Just diversify your strategy. So not all of it is reliant on somebody else giving you access to their distribution. Now, for example, a Dropbox, over 50% of acquisition comes through sharing. So I load something into my Dropbox, maybe I need to send it out for signature. Maybe I need to just share this file to transfer it to somebody. Maybe I just need to share this file as a final delivery to my clients that I was working with. Well, that recipient then is now aware of Dropbox, so it solved the brand awareness.
:
By that action of sharing, you actually almost activated that recipient too, so you don't need to educate them anymore on how the product works and whatnot. And the percentage of those recipients sign up to become Dropbox users, and that accounts for 50% of acquisition. That is a stable earned channel that nobody can compete with, and it's only for Dropbox to lose, so to speak. And we actually had our own growth pod focused on it. Because to optimize both sender experience and the recipient experience, because it was such a powerful growth and growth engine that driven the company, and every business should have an attempt at one of these.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think this is going to be a really good push for a lot of growth teams to think about what could we do here? Number seven. Four to go
Elena Verna :
Number seven. We've talked about this at least a little bit in our last podcast too. But I see this as a question that comes up all the time and something that people are afraid of to invest, which is a mistake. Every single company starts with their growth efforts focused either on product-led growth. Hey, I'm going to have everything being done self-serve or on sales in marketing. I'm going to have sales team and then I'm going to have marketing team and they're going to do all of the work and my product is just going to create the functionality. And that's good and fine for a while depending on how long that while is. But not overlaying every single way that you can grow through product, through marketing and through sales as an evolution. Is a huge mistake that a lot of growth teams fail to iterate on and innovate on.
:
The way that I best be comparing it is if product has a product-market fit, which is great, that product-market fit is not going to last that product forever. They're always going to have to have a second horizon. They're always going to have to have a product-market fit expansion efforts in order to continue to grab as many people and solve as many people's problems as possible and increasing their team. Well, the same comes with growth. If you have a growth model that works for you, that's wonderful, good for you. Optimize it, grow it, scale it, create a team that will be nurturing it and that will be amplifying it, but you're going to need to evolve it, and that evolution needs to come through overlaying other growth models on top of it. So, A, you are diversified away from just one growth model failing, because a lot of times you're going to get into a situation of law.
:
I love Andrew Chen's article here. It's called a Law of Shitty Clickthroughs. Where if you over-optimize the same thing over and over again, it has minimal returns, and some growth models have very limited time spans. Some of them are huge, some can grow for sharing loop at Dropbox. It's 17 years in the making and it's still firing. Good for it. That's amazing. But that's very much an anomaly. Most of growth loops spin out their ability to produce meaningful results for you within the first five to six to seven years.
:
So continuously overlaying those different growth models, and what I'm specifically talking about is product-led growth, marketing- led growth, sales-led growth, and introducing it into this ecosystem constantly is what really separates companies that can continue growing for a long periods of times versus the ones that can see a really big blip, potentially even unicorn type of growth rates of 70, 80, whatever plus percent, and then it starts to slow down. And don't wait until that slowdown happens. You need to really start thinking about different ways that you can attract people to grow so you are not leaving a gap in the market that somebody else can enter and own. As opposed to you playing in every way in where you can interact with your customer.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The way I think about this is the S-curves of every growth model and growth lever, right? Eventually it'll help and then slow down and see you want to find the next S-curve on things that'll grow your business.
Elena Verna :
Yes, absolutely. The way that I see it often is that especially when growth teams, they hit a really big result out of some initiative, they just keep trying to focus on that over and over again. And sometimes that focus is warranted. Like I said, our sharing loop at Dropbox has its own growth team against it. Great, but at the same time, a lot that's not warranted for all of the... Or you need to realize that there's not more choose to squeeze out of this thing and then you need to go and you need to move on.
:
Which actually brings me to a little bit of a next thing too, is you need to do it every 18 months. Because a lot of them are going to fail. And every five years or so, you for sure need new channel, new growth loops, new tactics, new engines so to speak, to power your growth engine. Whether it's overlaying sales on top of self-serve, whether you're doing a lot of, let's say virality right now in terms of acquisition and you're going into marketing a lot heavier. But every five years something big has to start taking a big portion of your volume. And for that every 18 years you need to introduce something-
Lenny Rachitsky :
18 months.
Elena Verna :
Sorry. Yeah. Every 18 months you need to introduce something new in order for it to continue evolving.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And was that number eight of the list we're going through or that's like a bonus piece of advice?
Elena Verna :
No, that's just a bonus piece of advice.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, cool. Okay, got it. And so the advice here essentially is you'll find something that is helping you grow, assume that will slow down at some point, start thinking about other levers and growth models to layer on top of that.
Elena Verna :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Something I've seen, let me know if you agree, is usually there's going to be one lever that has most of your growth for a long, long time, and so all other things are not going to be as big, but they are still important.
Elena Verna :
So the way I think about it is I try to focus 20 to 25% of growth teams time annually. Not every given sprint or not every given quarter, but annually to introduce a new growth loop, or to introduce a new channel, or to introduce something new that can potentially bring us additional umpth to our growth engine. I know that a lot of it is going to fail. None of it is gold on any growth metrics because you cannot goal it immediately, let's say on monetization or immediately acquisition. You're just going to cut it at its knees immediately if you're not going to let it evolve into something that can be monetized, that can be responsible for acquisition. So example on Mirrorverse, which is a user-generated content library of all of the mirror boards that people create, it took us probably 18 months until we started putting metrics expectations on it.
:
Before that, it was a thing that we were testing. And it was being used by a lot of people, but we're like, we don't even know exactly quite how this is going to fit all together. And then it started taking off as both engagement engine as well as acquisition engine. But it's important to constantly give your team room to try those new ideas. Otherwise, you're going to find yourself that your growth loops and your growth engine is slowing down and you don't have time to find that second horizon. And that is the worst situation to be in. That's where growth starts to slow down. And to recover out of that is impossible because you need revenue. You need revenue, you need revenue, you need revenue. And these growth loops on average take six months, a year, a year and a half to start producing even visible revenue. So that's why you need to start layering it very soon into your initiatives.
Lenny Rachitsky :
To make this even more concrete for people that are starting to like, oh, shit I got to do this. Can you just give us a list that doesn't have to be exhaustive of potential growth loops, levers, methods, engines for folks to consider? You've mentioned a few, but just give a list of people like, okay, got it. Maybe we'll try one of these.
Elena Verna :
I'm really big on creating a growth loop out of user generated content. I think with everything that is happening with AI and SEO at the moment, your biggest claim to fame on content strategy will be harnessing user generated content. Whether it's user generated templates, whether it's user generated case studies, review, whatever it is you need to start investing into it now, creating a library out of it, using it for activation purposes, using it then for acquisition purposes, using community to spark the conversations around it. That can be a really wonderful strategy that everybody should consider of whether there's juice in it within your product. Other ones can be, hey, we're a very, let's say individualistic product, but can we actually create a referral mechanism for it?
:
For B2C, that's actually very straightforward. A lot of B2C products thrive on referrals. For B2B, It can be more of invitation of other team members into the product to complete other jobs to be done. Hey, I've done this. I need my manager to see it. Can I create a report to share with my manager? And all of a sudden it starts to spread within the company. So creating additional almost product functionality that then creates these loops potentially for you. So it can be a slew of things. Obviously, I would highly recommend just understanding all of the menus of these earned tactics. I should do a blog post on it actually. And then just see what works for you or not. Because at least ideation step a bit has to happen. If especially you're relying on search engines for your acquisition, start thinking about some of the earned channels as soon as possible.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And even though you recommend spend more time on earned channels, owned channels, there's also explore SEO, explore paid growth, right? Sales?
Elena Verna :
Absolutely. I mean, almost everybody that's paid, arguably almost too soon potentially. There's a point to make that shouldn't be. A company should not be doing paid right now, but SEO, social resellers, all of those are wonderful tactics. Obviously, I skew very heavily towards earned channels just because once you stand that up, that's a gift that just keeps on giving and nobody can take that away from you. But that doesn't mean that other tactics and other channels should not be explored as well.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing. Let's keep going. So we have three to go. Number eight.
Elena Verna :
So number eight, this one's kind of a doozy and I think a lot of people don't do it. I don't know why they don't do it. I think it's such an incredible ability to propel forward. And that is, what doesn't work, as I said in the previous growth tactics, is trying to think that each problem is unique and you need to solve it on your own. Maybe this is not so much does it work, but not hiring advisors is something that I do not recommend for you to do. You can get access to anybody for one hour a week. Yeah, you'll have to pay them. So nobody's going to volunteer their hour. We're all very, very busy. But hiring advisors is the biggest career amplification and your business amplification can possibly do. Because to create a network of people that have all of these data points and those all of the other patterns that you can do is something that can just propel you so far forward.
:
That doesn't mean you have to do everything advisor says. That's not the point. They're not the strategy setter. But they are additional input into your decision-making that you otherwise wouldn't have. You can go and hire somebody from Atlassian. You can go and hire somebody from Airbnb that have been and lived through all of this and they can help you solving your problem. So I think any growth team that does not have an advisor is a growth team that is underperforming. Because even me who I've advised so many companies, I've operated at so many companies, I don't know everything. Every time I take an operator role, I hire advisors for myself. Because that is the fastest way to learn anything, and I often see these teams that just try to figure out everything on their own and not have any advisors on their boards, so to speak.
:
I'm not even talking like an official board. I'm talking not even an advisory board. But you can hire somebody as a contractor that will be your advisor, I think is a huge mistake, especially in this day and age. Because we have a big asymmetry of information. In our field, there's very little available to learn because we're all very cagey because of competition. But at the end of the day, people know a lot of the stuff and how it worked for them internally, and I highly, highly encourage you to not try to wing it on your own.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Along those lines, there's also advice of just like, don't worry about advisors. You never know if they're going to be useful. There's all these hanger-ons that join your startup and want to help, but they're not helpful. If you give one tip for a founder or team that's interviewing advisors, looking for an advisor to vet them to help them find people that are actually great, what would your tip be?
Elena Verna :
I have actually a good one. Many advisors might not like it though. I think that you should not hire an advisor until you do some sort of workshop with them on the problem that you're experiencing. See them in action. See what kind of information they can provide to you, because any advisor that is cagey about what they know is not the type of advisor that you're going to want to have on your team. You want to have somebody that has lived through it that can talk to you, to your face about it, that is able to have hard conversations. That is able to provide you necessary examples. That is able to give you and connect dots for you for necessary patterns. So instead of just saying, "Oh, this person looks good, let me hire them as an advisor." Say, "Hey, let's have a workshop first. I have this problem. I think that you can help me fix it."
:
Pay them for it, whatever their rate is for that workshop, for sure. See how they actually interact with your team and then hire them on ongoing retainer bases. Because that creates an interview loop that is very practical, that is very quick to understand whether you can work with them, they can work with you, and whether they have anything to contribute to you. And then every single month evaluate whether that advisor should stay with you. Some advisors, they only need to be with the company for three months and off they go, that's fine. Some of them might stick with you for four or five years, but every single month you should go and say, did they add any value? I'm not saying that advisors should have any monetary expectations like revenue attribution, so to speak to them. But did you find value in having conversations with them? Did they offer anything valuable to you?
Lenny Rachitsky :
That was an awesome tip. And I could see why people would be like, "God damn. Elena, don't say that." It makes so much sense. Here we go. Number nine. Here we go.
Elena Verna :
My last one is also that I see something way too often nowadays on growth teams specifically. This is very, very gross problem. And that is too much risk averseness on growth, where you're starting to test everything. If every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment, that's a problem and that is something that you should take a look at and say, what am I doing and why do I need a precise scientific measurement for every single thing that I touch in order for it to go to production or to hit the market?
:
It's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease, that slows down progress, that slows down velocity, that slows down learnings, that creates very terrible consequences to the output that growth teams produce. And it's a little bit counterintuitive, because experimentation is a way to do growth for growth teams and it's their process. Growth teams are meant to experiment, but I also think that experimenting on everything is something that is quite terrible once the team starts to get locked into that state, and it's really hard to get out of because they're then afraid to do any change until or unless that they test.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So where do you find that balance? I imagine people hearing this are like, oh, yes, this makes sense to me, and then they continue to test basically everything. What's kind of some heuristics you'd recommend for knowing, okay, just don't test that. Don't worry about it. You don't need credit for that win.
Elena Verna :
First of all, I think that people should trust their intuition a little bit more. Data is good, but data is only good if you have enough of it. So if you have low volume real estate, that is going to take you eight months to reach some sort of answer. Do you really want to test it for eight months? What's the point of it? My rule of thumb, if we cannot collect the sample size in the month, we shouldn't test it, period. Because it's just then it's not fast enough. We should just go and do pre versus post. Pre versus post is pretty powerful. It's also a way to assess your impact and you can still roll back if it doesn't work. But don't think that everything needs a scientific explanation to whether it needs to be moved forward or not.
:
Also, experimentation cannot be the way that people make decisions in the company. There's still so much about knowing your user, understanding the market for your brain to connect all of those dots and to know what needs to be an experience that your customers are going to want. That if scientific data, like a very tight determination of the probability that this is a success, it's important, absolutely do it because it might be a really big strategical pivot that you're planning to do. So it's a data point to validate that all of this extra work will be needed. It might be a very high traffic real estate that even 0.1% difference will mean millions of dollars for you.
:
But other than that, it should be just go, go, go. Do pre versus post. By the way, I'm not saying just release and move on. Release, do seven day, 24 hour readout, seven day readout, 28 day readout, even come back to it a year later and measure some of the retention or extension data that is associated with it.
:
But to test everything is debilitating to growth teams and app paralyzes them in its place. So kind of look at your initiatives and say, where do I need precision? And it's important and I can get it best in that versus where we should just go for it. And yeah, we will fail there too, and that's okay. And we can roll back and we can figure out how to make it better. But failure is going to happen regardless.
:
In statistics, six is tricky. Many people take it for face value versus it's just like a directional data point to say there's likely new distribution that has maybe a different mean, and 5% of the chances. If you measure in 95% statistical significance, you might not even be there, and yet really take it for so granted. Oh, it's going to drive this much lift. So I just think that people stop in this age of data, almost rely enough on their element intuition.
Lenny Rachitsky :
A lot of contrary intakes here. I love this. Elena, we've reached number 10. And I know number 10 is like a special one where it's more than one. Quick. Fire.
Elena Verna :
So number 10 is going to be my little fire round. My fire round on little things that I just see people spending way too much time on it. It hurts my heart, because it's not going to drive any results on them. So number one. Color optimizations. Because the love of God, a blue is a blue is a blue. As long as it's accessible and as long as it's bright enough, off you go. You do not need to test the shades of blue or test it against green or so on. Pick a color, move on, please don't spend time on it. That's an early 2000s tactic. It doesn't work anymore. We pass that in technology sector.
:
Number two. Third party signups. A lot of times we think, oh, we're going to get so much more acquisition if we add Google Auth or if we add Facebook Auth or Slack Auth or Microsoft Auth, whichever auth you want to add to it. In some cases, it's very important to have third party auth. So for example, if you are a developer product, please have a GitHub auth. It's kind of unnecessary. The developers already have the account there, have them connect with it as opposed to create a new one. However, if you're a productivity product, email is fine for the longest time. Gmail is nice. It's not going to drive more acquisition for you. You're just going to do a makeshift, and two more people...
Elena Verna :
... more acquisition for you. You're just going to do a makeshift and two more people using it. It's not going to create incrementality, it's not going to improve your activation, it's not going to improve your retention. It's not a growth tactic. It's part of you just customer experience that you want to invest into. Number three, on the fire round, one email wonders. We stress too much about this one email that we're going to send to this one customer group. And we're like, oh gosh, how much lift is it going to cost? It'll never cause any lift. You will never work as a one-off email. Too few people open it on average, 25% open rate. At best you'll get 40 to 50% open rate. Too few people click it. One email will never do anything. If you're going to go into email, please think about it as a series about communication, about how it interacts with product communication.
:
It's a whole strategy. It's a whole thing. Please don't stress about one-off email. Never test a change in one email. It'll never work. You're going to have to do the whole god damn thing and see how it's going to do. Not just one email, just never going to work.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm definitely guilty of this one. That is a really good one for sure. And it's so obvious in hindsight, so I love that you share that.
Elena Verna :
Yes. And then the last one, growth teams are often too obsessed about removing friction. Because if we remove the steps, then more people are going to get to the destination. And to an extent, if you cause horrible friction in your product where it's just confusing about what the next step is, I agree, go fix the friction of the cognitive load that it takes to complete a step. That is the friction that you should be working on. However, just removing steps or yanking or simplifying things to an oblivion where you lose an identity of what you even do or what you're capable of doing is a completely failed growth tactic. So simplifying may be an initiative of a different problem that you're solving, but if you ever have a line item on your roadmap that says simplified onboarding, please cross it out. It's not going to work because simplifying onboarding is an action.
:
What is the problem that you're solving? You're never trying to solve a problem of simplifying. You always have a problem of people are confused in it, but people don't know where to go or they get lost in it or they're not educated enough. That is the problem. And simplifying might be a solution, but it can never be a problem on its own. And too many growth teams are just obsessed with this notion that came out I think in early 2000s, like, oh, simplifying is the biggest growth hack that you can do. Do it. It's only a solution to a very specific problem set of too much complexity.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow, that was a big one to end on. That I think will help a lot of people avoid wasting time. Again, a whole other podcast conversation probably focus just on onboarding advice that you probably have, that I know you have. We've reached the last item. Is there anything else you want to share about this list before we move on?
Elena Verna :
No, I think we've spent too much time. We're ready to go.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Not too much. Just enough time. And kind of on a note, I want to call an audible, and so we were going to talk through all of your favorite frameworks. I like the way this conversation has gone. I don't want people to get overwhelmed with information. So one idea is just list maybe your favorite growth frameworks just for folks to go check these out and not spend too much time on each one.
Elena Verna :
Yep, let's do that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay.
Elena Verna :
Great. So the list of my favorite growth frameworks. And to me framework by the way, it's not a solution, it's a pattern. It's a pattern that exists across almost every single company out there and it's a starting point for your ideation and to figure out how you can almost shortcut to possible list of solutions as opposed to trying to figure out too hard of how to even define a problem on its own. So number one, it's probably expected if anybody has read anything or listened to me talk is growth loops. I think anybody who thinks about growth and anybody who thinks about growth in the funnel fashion versus understanding what the growth loops are is missing out on the ability to create sustainable growth engine. So it's very important to think about action, reaction that generates another action and it's a self-contained flywheel they can spin. A lot of resources on it at Reforge, Brian Balfour and Casey Winters and Andrew Chen wrote a lot about this.
:

**Highly recommend anybody looking into. My next favorite growth framework's actually written by you, Lenny, and Dan, which is a race car framework. Everybody has a really hard time often thinking about what are all of them parts of growth initiatives and which are long-term, short-term, how much are they going to actually produce in results? And race car framework is wonderful because it separates different initiatives into, hey, there's some engines, loops that are just going to keep on spinning. There's some fuel that you're going to need to add into it, potentially like paid marketing dollars. There are some turbo boosts that you may have in your race car that are going to be, let's say big user conferences that you're going to hold as a product or there's [inaudible 01**:

17:22] and optimizations that you're going to need to do pouring oil into that engine so that actually performs correctly. It's beautiful. I talk about it all the time with everybody.
:
The next favorite growth framework for me comes from Bengali and that's adjacent to user theory. I think that was very powerful in terms of thinking about growth evolution. And as we talked about adding different growth models to your growth ecosystem, different growth loops, but also adjacent users which are outside of your ideal customer profiles or ICP, outside of your core user and how growth team can really bring them in and add additional oomph to your product without even expansion of product market fit by just optimizing their experiences. I'm going to stop at these three because I think those are the most powerful ones.
Lenny Rachitsky :

**Cool. On that last one, [inaudible 01**:

18:11] Bengali was on the podcast. We'll link to that episode if you want to go deeper on the adjacent using user theory. I love how that was a few minutes on things that could change people's life if they adopt one of these frameworks and learn how to think about growth in this way. It's such a powerful mental model for thinking about all this stuff you've been talking about this entire conversation.
Elena Verna :
Yes, those frameworks are like my church in my mind of my system of beliefs of how I think about growth and how I think about it on a strategic level of owning it as a strategy, not just like a tactic or an initiative.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The church of Elena Verna. Amazing. Okay, so before we wrap up, I want to bring us over to Contrarian Corner, recurring segment on this podcast where I like to ask the guest if there's something they believe that most other people don't believe. Contrarian opinion you might say. Is there anything that comes to mind?
Elena Verna :
I do have a very contrarian opinion, although it's not so much related to growth as opposed to maybe your personal growth and my contrarian opinion is that full-time jobs are not the best way to monetize the skill that you have. It's one of the packages that everybody should evaluate and take advantage of, but too many people blindly default to that package and don't explore other options that are both available on the market as well as best suited for their personalities, for their interests, and for their skill set. It's like a default plan that everybody subscribes to that is faulty in itself.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow. Okay. Wait, we got to hear more. So what are some other packages? I think we're buying some of these packages, these other options, but I guess what should people be thinking about when you say this in terms of what can they actually do and explore?
Elena Verna :
I'll premise it to saying I don't want to rain parade on full-time roles. They're wonderful on video ability, to learn to get the expertise and depending on which career stage you are at full-time roles might be the absolute necessity for you to move on to and unlock the next level. However, full-time roles boxes into one company that may not be a great fit for us culturally, for our skills, for our ambitions, for our interests. Life is too short for that and ability to really go and figure out your own best monetization model, just like you work on that for your business, you should work for that on yourself without an assumption oftentimes is the only option that you should have.
:
So what are the other options? There's so many, obviously the couple known ones. Freelancing, you can be a contractor. I do a lot of advising and consulting because for my brain of how I work and how I like to puzzle solve and pattern match, it works much better to be horizontal across many companies versus vertical on one specific one. But that doesn't mean I still don't take those vertical engagements to deepen my knowledge into any specific topic. But overall it's a lot more interesting for me to pattern match across multiple companies and help them grow as opposed to just focusing on one.
:
There's interim engagements where there's a predetermined end date to your agreement. There's fractional engagements where you're working part-time on something as opposed to engulfing yourself completely. There's other ways to create courses, there's a way to create newsletters and monetize them like you're doing such a fantastic job. So there's just so many options and people are sometimes paralyzed by fear of instability, that it creates when you start to explore other options because you don't have that contract with that one company that provides you that paycheck every two weeks to rely on. But at the same time you can create diversification for your career and you depend on when you need to pull that trigger and when is the right time for you to explore. But to spend your entire career only assuming full-time is the only way I think is a complete mistake that a lot of people are doing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
One of my favorite posts of yours along these lines, which is around increasing... What you want to do is increase optionality and I guess talk about that because I think it's a really powerful piece of advice.
Elena Verna :
So this advice of career optionality, being the ultimate north star for anybody in their professional journey is something that I'm very strong on because a lot of people have the goal of, I don't know, maybe I want to be a VP or I want to become a CEO. Or I don't know, I want to be a manager and I want to people manage. And this becomes their north star and they start working towards it. But a lot of people when they get to their perceived corporate ladder north stars find themselves extremely dissatisfied, depressed even by how terrible that job is. Could people manage your job? I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy because it's a terrible job if you don't enjoy it and you don't know if you're going to like it until you actually do it.
:
So I think setting a title as your goal, which so many of us have titles as goals, is very wrong way to think about it as opposed to saying, "Hey, my goal professional is actually to have options so I can choose what I want to do. So I can choose what fits my life right now that I can choose what fits my skills and that fits my personality and that makes me happy."
:
And to get career optionality, if that's your goal, you start thinking about your progression a lot differently. You're not starting to think about it of what will get me to the next title. You start thinking about what will can I do next year that will increase my option pool? And that's very different than just getting to a higher title. And if you start thinking about evaluating opportunities or whether you should stay at the company, whether you should move at the company from the lens of does it increase my options if I stay at this company for one more year or does it keep it the same or does it actually potentially decrease? That is the right way to find your ultimate happy place and happy job that brings you energy, that brings you happiness versus just going for a title and then being very disappointed with what that brings along with it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Amazing advice. So important and something I'll add that I think is a balance to what people may be feeling here is like, oh, I'll just bounce around all the best logo companies and create this killer resume. I think you also need to build depth and actual experience that you can tap into if you do any of these things. For example, a lot of people want to jump to like I'm going to be a newsletter person, I'm going to start a podcast, be an advisor before they've done anything real and you have nothing to actually base your advice on and that part is very important.
Elena Verna :
You have to earn your right to unlock optionality and earning that right does usually lie within full-time jobs. That is a universal truth. But then at some point you should start not just looking at full- time jobs as the only option that you have. You should start to think about when can you start unlocking new ones and testing the market on it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
The other point is that you've been a great example of is it's not a one-way door. You can have full-time job, go to something else, go back to full-time job, be an advisor, be an intern person, be a newsletter person. You do that really well.
Elena Verna :
You should have to do it all. It's all a menu of options and you pick a menu item that fits your best in any given point of your life. It's never say never and never shut the door on anything. Absolutely.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh my god, Elena, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lighting round, is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with, maybe a last nugget or thought or not because covered a lot already.
Elena Verna :
No, I think we've covered so much. I don't want to overwhelm.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's do it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Elena Verna :
Yes, I'm ready.
Lenny Rachitsky :
First question, surprise, surprise. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?
Elena Verna :
Okay, so I just finished this book that I love so much, it's not a professional book, but it's Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. It's the same author that wrote Martian. Martian also was made into a movie. So good, so good. Can't put it down. I think I read it like two days straight. So highly recommend that. And the next one that I also started reading right now is Body Burst. Body Burst is so good. It's actually takes into account AI and how we can upload our consciousness in AI and what can happen with that. So highly recommend that, I think it's actually closer to what potentially can be in the truth for us in the future than not. But I'm a big sci-fi geek, so I read mostly sci-fi books.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I have a sci-fi recommendation for you that comes from Noah Smith. I love his newsletters called Noah Opinion and he has a list of his favorite sci-fi books that I've been working my way through. It's called, you may have read it by Werner Vogel, Fire Upon The Deep. Have you heard of this?
Elena Verna :
No, I have not.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. It's described as not a sci-fi but space, like a space opera where it's epic, the most epic scale of universe story.
Elena Verna :
I'll download it tonight, it'll be on my list.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It takes a little bit to get into. It's quite unique, but you just keep going and it's incredible and AI plays a big role in it actually.
Elena Verna :
That's awesome. I'll download it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There you go. Okay, question number two. Favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?
Elena Verna :
Yes. I just got to watching Beef on Netflix. It's so good. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, Beef. You should watch it. It's a limited series. It's so good. It will run through. I love Veep on HBO. So funny. I've probably watched it two times already the entire series and I'll probably watch it more because it just cracks me up every time. I think this is actually how our government works, so I'm very intrigued by that. And then the last one that I really liked that is coming up with the season two now. So you should catch up with season one is Last One of Us. If you don't like zombie movies or zombie shows, don't watch it. But if zombie and apocalypse is your cup of tea, Last One of Us is so good.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Or the Last of Us? Or Last One of Us? Last of Us.
Elena Verna :
Is it Last of Us?
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm Googling while we talk, Last of Us. I think it's Last of Us. Yeah, the Last of Us.
Elena Verna :
Oh, Last of Us. Okay, Last of Us.
Lenny Rachitsky :
You're saying there's a third season coming soon. That's exciting. I didn't know that.
Elena Verna :
Yeah, it's so good.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, I love it as well. Great pick. Okay. Your favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?
Elena Verna :
I recently discovered that they make heated shoes and that changed my life. My feet are always cold and they are boots that actually have heated wires through them and I'm obsessed.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And are you like charging it, like USB plugin kind of thing?
Elena Verna :
Yeah, I just come in, I plug them in and then I go outside and I'm warm and I think it's magical. I have a jacket, also heated jacket, now I have shoes. I just need my gloves and I'll be all set.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love the USB powered clothing. And we should know you live not in Silicon Valley, you live on the East Coast sort of?
Elena Verna :
Central. In Central. The coldest it gets is 30s here, but I'm always cold, so this is just my love language is something heated that I can sit on. I'm that cat sits underneath the light all the time. And then I also just got AirPod Max, my headphones. I couldn't connect it to my computer. Still technical issues on that, but I love them. The sound is amazing. That's my new favorite gadget that I'm obsessed about.
Lenny Rachitsky :
What a cool combination, heated shoes and AirPods. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to that you find useful in work and life?
Elena Verna :
Yeah, it's really one, progress over perfection. I think that you just need to... The velocity of information is far more important than something that I think is perfect and perfection is an outcome that you get to. But progress over perfection all day, any day.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Very appropriate for a head of growth person.
Elena Verna :
Yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Final question. You're not only one of the smartest people I've met on growth, you're also one of the funniest people on social media, especially on LinkedIn. If people aren't following you, they should. They will not only learn, they'll also be highly entertained. Is there a favorite meme that you created that you are very proud of that you can describe that we might want to link to?
Elena Verna :
Yeah, so I also want to say a lot of people hate me for doing so much memes as well because they think it's not serious. And I actually, I want to rebuttal that really quickly because I think humor is the best way to disarm people and to point out very painful situations that we're facing with every single day or conundrums without putting anybody on defense. Because we can all laugh at the absurdity of the lives that we live in every single day. And a picture's worth a thousand words. And sometimes memes are just the best way to communicate the most complex situations that we are facing within our corporate world. And they help us understand how common all of those situations are. We're not unique. You're not feeling alone by feeling down about what happened. Everybody's going through the same thing. So that's why I love memes because they help connect people on both sides.
:
Even if you're making fun of one side because they're like, yeah, that is true and this is so funny. So I'm a big proponent of that just because I think it's actually a better way to both unite people and just talk about hard problems that otherwise would be not read if you put it in words.
:

**But my favorite meme is actually one of the first ones that I've created and I think it's from Family Guy where they have an elephant and the penguin standing and then there's Moses I think, or some biblical character saying, "What the hell is this?" Looking at the elephant and the penguin. And the result of it is a child that has a penguin body and an elephant head. And if you think about elephant as product and penguin as marketing, what the hell is this is gross. Which is a byproduct, a weird, weird byproduct, product and marketing merged together that doesn't really fit with either, yet it's its own entity. I don't know. I think that that's the best to describe to people what [inaudible 01**:

33:14] is.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So appropriate. Also, it's hard to describe a meme and make it feel funny. So good job. Thank you for doing that. We'll link to this meme in our show notes. Elena, this was incredible. Thank you again. Thank you for being our first ever third return guest. Hopefully there will be many more episodes of Elena Verna. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?
Elena Verna :

**Find me on LinkedIn or my Substack. I'm not competing with you Lenny, but I share a lot of my thoughts and everything that I learned on my own Substack. It's just elenaverna.com. LinkedIn is for all of my memes, so go there if you want to laugh, but if you want to learn from what I'm learning, go to my Substack. And how you can be useful? Tell me what problems you're facing now. Don't tell me, oh, how growth is slowing down, what should I do? I can't help you with that, too broad, but if you're having a situation, there's often really good [inaudible 01**:

34:09] for me to go and write about it or to do more research about it. So I just love to hear what some people's minds, so I can both help them connect their dots as well as learn about it myself.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And what's the best way for them to do that? Is it like DM me on LinkedIn, any other-
Elena Verna :
DM me on LinkedIn or just reply to my Substack newsletter email. It goes directly into my personal inbox, so I read every single one of them.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's a really good tip. People don't know that when you get an email on Substack, if you reply, just goes straight to the author.
Elena Verna :
Exactly.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Elena, thank you so much for being here.
Elena Verna :
Okay, thank you for having me, Lenny.
Lenny Rachitsky :
