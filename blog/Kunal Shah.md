## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### So I recently asked the question

which species or animals have survived for more than 100 million years without changing too much and what is common in all of them?
KUNAL SHAH :
So GPT came up with an interesting answer which says that sharks, horseshoe crabs, crocodiles, and all of these animals have survived to do this thing.
KUNAL SHAH :
So three distinct traits were, one, ability to reduce metabolism at will.
KUNAL SHAH :
It's fascinating.
KUNAL SHAH :

### I can bring down my metabolism by 1

20 or a crazy, crazy scale that they can bring the metabolism down.
KUNAL SHAH :
By the way, ancient yogis have demonstrated this as well.
KUNAL SHAH :
It comes from the same yogic practice.
KUNAL SHAH :
The second thing is about, and if you think about companies, the context is the same.
KUNAL SHAH :
If COVID came, you could slow down your metabolism and survive, right?
KUNAL SHAH :
Or you burned your way out and disappeared.
KUNAL SHAH :
The second thing that was interesting was the very high ...

**So I recently asked the question**:

which species or animals have survived for more than 100 million years without changing too much and what is common in all of them?
KUNAL SHAH :
So GPT came up with an interesting answer which says that sharks, horseshoe crabs, crocodiles, and all of these animals have survived to do this thing.
KUNAL SHAH :
So three distinct traits were, one, ability to reduce metabolism at will.
KUNAL SHAH :
It's fascinating.
KUNAL SHAH :

**I can bring down my metabolism by 1**:

20 or a crazy, crazy scale that they can bring the metabolism down.
KUNAL SHAH :
By the way, ancient yogis have demonstrated this as well.
KUNAL SHAH :
It comes from the same yogic practice.
KUNAL SHAH :
The second thing is about, and if you think about companies, the context is the same.
KUNAL SHAH :
If COVID came, you could slow down your metabolism and survive, right?
KUNAL SHAH :
Or you burned your way out and disappeared.
KUNAL SHAH :
The second thing that was interesting was the very high conversion rate on every attempt to secure food.
KUNAL SHAH :
They don't go around chasing randomly and doing things.
KUNAL SHAH :
They have a very high conversion rate, which means high judgment and the deadliest bite.
KUNAL SHAH :
So they'll not chase many options, but if they chase something, they will have the biggest bite and they'll convert it.
KUNAL SHAH :
And the third thing that was more interesting was that they have survived all sorts of crazy environmental changes, just adapting. And adaptation comes from curiosity.
KUNAL SHAH :
And you could see those people.
KUNAL SHAH :
In COVID, there were two sets of people, who were completely gone into a shell and there were those who were curious.
KUNAL SHAH :
“Okay, so what do I do with this?”
KUNAL SHAH :
“What happens now?”
KUNAL SHAH :
“Do I need to change something?”
KUNAL SHAH :
“Do I need to tweak something?”
KUNAL SHAH :
So the ability to change very quickly.
KUNAL SHAH :
I often feel that curiosity is that demonstration of the ability to adapt and learn, and you only create more information asymmetry.
KUNAL SHAH :
To me, wealth is nothing but information asymmetry.
KUNAL SHAH :
All the best companies in the world have unfair information asymmetry.
KUNAL SHAH :
And that comes from curiosity. Because you're constantly collecting dots, connecting dots, collecting dots, connecting dots, and end up creating this unique edge for yourself and information asymmetry for yourself.
KUNAL SHAH :
And if you assume that “I have collected enough,” no human life is going to be enough to connect and connect all the dots.
KUNAL SHAH :
We'll never be able to get..
KUNAL SHAH :
And sometimes I envy the stuff that you do because you are efficiently connecting and collecting dots by having the luxury of all these people to talk to, and you are making more dots getting connected.
KUNAL SHAH :
So your information asymmetry is growing.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Wait until you IPO, and then someday maybe leave CRED and then you could start this podcast with everyone like this and connect all the dots.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And I think that's a reference to Danny Meyer who's the founder of all these fancy restaurants and big on hospitality and has this phrase “Always be collecting dots”, I think ABCD, I’ll link to that.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Yeah.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Okay.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Wait, this is really interesting, this list of what are the common traits of the most long-lasting animals?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
They can lower their metabolism at will, they have a high conversion rate to get food, and they've survived many types of environments.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And I think there's a lot you can transform as you've done, to startups and leaders.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
This could be its own…
LENNY RACHITSKY :
if you haven't written about this, this would be a cool blog post.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I'm curious who you look up to in business, either in India and outside India.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Who comes to mind where you're like, I really inspired, I'm inspired by these folks?
KUNAL SHAH :
I often tell people that I hate the word ‘favorite’ because it tells me to become limited in my mind.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I stay away from ‘favorite’, but I learn all the time from everybody.
KUNAL SHAH :
And there are so many people to learn from across the world and in history, in the recent past and every time you'll discover fascinating, extraordinary things about them.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I don't think I have a person.
KUNAL SHAH :

**I am this person who thinks about about**:

”How did they solve this hard problem.”
KUNAL SHAH :
So one of the things that we started doing recently and not very ritualistic about it so far is, I ask myself and my key reportees every month, we go around the table and ask ourselves, ”What are the hardest problems we solved last month?”
KUNAL SHAH :
And it's very hard to come up with an answer.
KUNAL SHAH :
And if you do this to the product leaders, just go around and ask, “What are the hard problems you solved last month?”
KUNAL SHAH :
You'll realize that we all stay very busy and displacement is hard.
KUNAL SHAH :
But if you notice extraordinarily successful people, they'll have a lot more content to talk about every month, every quarter because they're obsessed with making that big displacement and it does not come by being busy.
KUNAL SHAH :
And that's another thing that you cannot chase the big thing.
KUNAL SHAH :
You don't see a crocodile being busy.
KUNAL SHAH :
You see a crocodile just waiting patiently at the watering hole for that best meal and have the deadliest bite for that.
KUNAL SHAH :
So the beautiful definition of predators I read was “one who burns the least amount of calories to earn the most amount of calories.”
KUNAL SHAH :
So how do you become that?
KUNAL SHAH :
And I think when I meet people who are extraordinary at that, and it comes in all shapes and forms, I learn something from them.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
So in these meetings you have, are you judging people's success based on how many hard problems they solve?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Now that they've heard this, they're going to be like, I need more.
KUNAL SHAH :
Because if you're a senior, what is the role of a senior person?
KUNAL SHAH :
You have to be the chief problem solver.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I love that.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I often think of leaders as professional firefighters who have just endless fires to put out.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Kind of along the lines of people and where you learn from, are there any sources of content?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
This is actually an audience question on Twitter.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Anurag Verma asks this, “What are your favorite sources of content to learn from in terms of what's happening in the world and what to pay attention to?”
KUNAL SHAH :
I wish I could think of an answer.
KUNAL SHAH :
My method of collecting information is mostly about, I come up with conjectures in my head and then I go all over the place to find out if there is proof if what I'm saying is true or not.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, I recently came up with a conjecture that everybody who has been successful in the history of business of vices, historically has done a lot of philanthropy to create a good image for themselves, and therefore is being treated as a respected citizen versus being treated as a person who did vices to make wealth.
KUNAL SHAH :
And then I asked GPT to come up with 50 people who did that and what were their vices?
KUNAL SHAH :
How did they change the reputation by doing lots of philanthropy and all of that stuff?
KUNAL SHAH :
Then a thing happens.
KUNAL SHAH :
And then I research in all sorts of directions. And I have no boundaries if I go to chemistry or physics or human behavior to discover some universal principles.
KUNAL SHAH :
So my method of learning is to constantly come up with conjectures from the dots that you have connected and then absolutely work hard to find proof of it and then use that to connect to the next dot.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I often tell people that every book you read makes your brain poorer to read the next book.
KUNAL SHAH :
That's the purpose of books, but that's true for every single thing we learn.
KUNAL SHAH :
It makes our brain poorerfor the next thing that we are supposed to learn.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Is there a recent example of that where you got super sucked into some topic?
KUNAL SHAH :
Well, it's my daily life.
KUNAL SHAH :
I get sucked into topics every now and then.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, I've been thinking about second order effects of AI and what happens to countries and jobs and how to expect some of these things to change, not change, rate of change, rate of skill change.
KUNAL SHAH :
I got recently obsessed with what happens to lab grown diamonds if they become big?
KUNAL SHAH :
Does it kill diamonds?
KUNAL SHAH :
Does it make diamonds bigger?
KUNAL SHAH :
And then I looked at parallels.
KUNAL SHAH :
So, the pearl industry was very big before culture.
KUNAL SHAH :
Cultured pearls came and the high status of pearls disappeared because everybody could have pearls.
KUNAL SHAH :
But not too long ago, pearls were a very royal thing . Every prince and princess used to have pearls around them, but as soon as it was easy to manufacture in a lab, it lost its value.
KUNAL SHAH :
So then I think should I be shorting or going long on diamonds thinking about what happens?
KUNAL SHAH :
But there'll be a temporary period of making a lot of money on lab grown diamonds, which will kill... it'll become parasitic on the status of diamonds and destroy all of the profit pools.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
You heard it here first, time to buy some diamond futures.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I feel like there's no one in the world ChatGPT impacted more than you considering how much you want to spend digging into random topics.
KUNAL SHAH :
I often wonder, Lenny, that if you took the most serious people and made their GPT searches public, a lot of people will learn because the problem of GPT is now it'll make the people with great questions do well, versus people who are looking for basic answers.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I think the world is going to be unfair to people who will ask great questions.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Interesting.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Okay.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Well, I got to ask you, is there any advice you have for asking great questions that has helped you in your work and career and life?
KUNAL SHAH :
Whenever somebody has many choices and they make the right choice in whatever domain they have.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, let's say you could hire anybody but you hired great people, or let's say you could have married anybody, but you married a great person and so on and so forth. Everybody has many choices to make.
KUNAL SHAH :
How do they make choices for that domain of expertise?
KUNAL SHAH :
And I think that is the most, and many times they're not going to be able to explain how they make great choices.
KUNAL SHAH :
They'll have to really go into that because they don't really have their mental models figured out.
KUNAL SHAH :
They cannot articulate, they cannot coach, they cannot explain.
KUNAL SHAH :
But if you can figure out how they make great decisions in general, in whatever domain of work they're doing, you'll find many interesting insights coming over there.
KUNAL SHAH :
The other good question to ask is about second order thinking.
KUNAL SHAH :
What do they think will happen to the world and why did they come to that conclusion?
KUNAL SHAH :
And you see that full chain of thoughts is very powerful.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, second order thinking is known to be the most powerful trait to predict the success of somebody.
KUNAL SHAH :
But I often wonder what happened in the childhood of people who became great at second order thinking.
KUNAL SHAH :
And that question is not fully discovered or discussed yet.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I've found some loose examples such as if you played strategy games or only physical games as a strong correlation to building
KUNAL SHAH :
So rigor came from physical games, but second order thinking came from playing strategy games as a kid.
KUNAL SHAH :
And if you had both, you could do really well in general because you have discipline and second order thinking together.
KUNAL SHAH :
Then did you ever have an exercise of looking at history?
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, one of the things I recommend for parents to do with their kids, I call it the ‘Whyfi school’, is ask them one ‘why’ question every meal and let them come back with answers the next day.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, “Why do humans wear jewelry” and ”Why is something a certain way?”
KUNAL SHAH :
And let them go into the full depth of history and find out.
KUNAL SHAH :
Why is it so expensive to advertise in the Super Bowl?
KUNAL SHAH :
And so on and so forth.
KUNAL SHAH :
You just take one question.
KUNAL SHAH :
And if you train them on why, they evolve at a very different rate because how, what are the questions which do not evolve at a much higher rate, because ‘why’ is the deep question and it breaks a lot of things in your head.
KUNAL SHAH :
Or another question about origin stories that “How did elevators come into being?” and "what made your phones happen?”
KUNAL SHAH :
“What made microphones happen and why is it called microphone and why is it called a phone?”
KUNAL SHAH :
And if you just want to go into this depth, you'll see people build second order thinking automatically because either you go into history and see second order thinking coming along with that, or you play games that train your brain for second order thinking with the spectrum.
KUNAL SHAH :
But that's a broad range of things that I think people should be asking.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I'm looking forward to Kunal’s children's raising book, like a book to help you raise kids.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
This could be your future.
KUNAL SHAH :
I don't have kids so I can run experiments on everybody else's kids.
KUNAL SHAH :
So it's a great thing to do.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I feel like with these questions, I think the rule has to be you can't just ask ChatGPT for the answer if the block it-
KUNAL SHAH :
Actually it's not bad.
KUNAL SHAH :
I think you should encourage it because we have to assume that we are going to be all co-pilots of AI now.
KUNAL SHAH :
What you have to do is derive the second order insight that, “Okay, this is true.
KUNAL SHAH :
Where is the similarity of this in somewhere else?”
KUNAL SHAH :
Give me an example of this found somewhere else, and so on and so forth.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Amazing.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Okay.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I have just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
First, let's visit the contrarian corner.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I'm curious. What's something that you believe that very few other people would agree with you on and why do you hold that belief?
KUNAL SHAH :
Our understanding of wealth and what wealth is, is flawed.
KUNAL SHAH :
To me, wealth is nothing but storage of energy.
KUNAL SHAH :
And therefore the reason wealth is not zero sum is because energy is, and we are just finding ways to convert energy to our advantage.
KUNAL SHAH :
We are the only species that has managed to convert all forms of energy to our advantage.
KUNAL SHAH :
Kinetic energy and fuel and sound and solar.
KUNAL SHAH :
No other species has done this.
KUNAL SHAH :
And therefore, since the industrial revolution, our wealth has gone like this and continues to be like that.
KUNAL SHAH :
AI and nuclear fission and all this stuff will kind of take us right there.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I have a strong view that we will never, never have equality of wealth.
KUNAL SHAH :
In fact, chasing that is actually a bad idea.
KUNAL SHAH :
But if you let people do well and chase wealth, they have enough wealth for everybody else and we could help a lot of people out.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I think it's complicated because we can have all these democratic arguments that wealth is concentrated and all that, but that's the physics of wealth.
KUNAL SHAH :
It'll always be concentrated.
KUNAL SHAH :
You change these mediums, companies, countries.
KUNAL SHAH :
To me, wealth is nothing but an entropic complexity that'll keep changing its form and shape.
KUNAL SHAH :
You can keep fighting it or accept its physics and reap the benefit of that physics.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I think Elon had this interesting point that wealth is just a database where everyone's wealth I guess is just a row in the database and here's how much everyone has and you're just transferring numbers around and that's the whole economy.
KUNAL SHAH :
No, but the nuance that is important is that you can actually increase the database size infinitely.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
That's true.
KUNAL SHAH :
And therefore his vision of the sun's energy, if you really convert all the energy to our advantage, the amount of wealth we will create for humans is disproportionate.
KUNAL SHAH :
And all the species that are managed to collaborate and cooperate to create wealth, for example, let's define wealth as biomass.
KUNAL SHAH :
So let's say ants and bacteria and humans are the only few things that have the largest biomass on this planet because we figured out how to make energy work to our advantage.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Wow.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I love all the directions we've gone.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Probably the last question, is there a story of failure in your career that would be interesting to share?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Something that taught you an important lesson?
KUNAL SHAH :
It's a series of failures.
KUNAL SHAH :
I think there is no escape for anybody who's done anything in life, not failed a lot, like every day, every thing.
KUNAL SHAH :
But I would say that many initiatives, many products, companies that I've built have absolutely failed, hirings that have failed, trust broken, betrayals.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I think there is no end to it.
KUNAL SHAH :
But I think entrepreneurs have this weird ability to forget about failures and almost turn that into a lesson that you hold, and you forget the story.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, COVID has literally no memory for me.
KUNAL SHAH :
I just don't remember what was COVID.
KUNAL SHAH :
It's just a blank in my head right now.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I think that humans are great at forgetting the memory of failure, but remember the lesson from failure.
KUNAL SHAH :
But I think I'm constantly learning, and I often believe that life is too short to make all our mistakes ourselves.
KUNAL SHAH :
So we should be learning from other people's failures as well.
KUNAL SHAH :
And a lot of times we don't do that because we believe that we are special, nothing like that will happen to us, but as humans, we should be learning.
KUNAL SHAH :
I would say that my life started from a failure.
KUNAL SHAH :
My family went through a severe financial crisis.
KUNAL SHAH :
I had to start working from age 15 and I feel till date, I'm just trying to escape that failure that happened in the family.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I think many of us are just fighting that initial large failure that we've had and don't want to be anywhere near that.
KUNAL SHAH :
And although we are significantly far away from that, the feeling is exactly that.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Circles back to one of our first few questions about the chips on shoulders driving a lot of motivation.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
There's this phrase, ”Chips on shoulders drive chips in pockets.”
KUNAL SHAH :
That's interesting.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Yeah.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Is there anything more you want to share about that early challenge you ran into or is that something you've shared often?
KUNAL SHAH :
No, I mean I've shared that enough, but I used to not talk about it before because I used to think that I would get some sympathy for that.
KUNAL SHAH :
And only in the recent past did I speak about it because I want people to realize that I was not some gifted kid who had some rich parents who made me extraordinarily bright and put me in great schools and colleges and I made my way through that.
KUNAL SHAH :
I used to not talk about it earlier because there's a lot of tendency to give sympathy to those people who say, "Oh, this guy had struggled."
KUNAL SHAH :
And I don't want to be given any credit for playing that poverty card or this card or struggling for food card.
KUNAL SHAH :
That's not an excuse.
KUNAL SHAH :
There are so many people in the world who've done extraordinarily well because they had the gift of struggle.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I often tell people that this is the biggest curse of successful parents, that that's the only gift they'll not be able to give to their kids, the gift of struggle that they had.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Wow.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I think about that a lot.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
We have a kid, he's eight months now, and so I'm trying to figure out the balance of struggle versus making life easy and great, a new challenge for me to figure out.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else, Kunal, you wanted to share or leave listeners with?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Anything?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Any last nuggets of thoughts?
KUNAL SHAH :
Well, I would love for the listeners from different fields of product to share what you're learning without being fearful of the judgment of your peers, because there are many, many people who are learning only because you share your evolution and your thoughts.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I believe that a lot more could be contributing.
KUNAL SHAH :
And a lot of your listeners are really bright people.
KUNAL SHAH :
If they all shared, many people from many places in the world would learn and achieve some amount of success.
KUNAL SHAH :
Thanks to your sharing.
KUNAL SHAH :
Amazing.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Are you ready?
KUNAL SHAH :
All set.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Let's do it.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
KUNAL SHAH :
It keeps changing a lot, but my books are usually around understanding human behavior.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I keep changing based on the person, but I think it's the biggest subject.
KUNAL SHAH :
All our customers, all our investors, all our employees, all our relationships are all humans.
KUNAL SHAH :
And the subject that we are weakest on is human behavior.
KUNAL SHAH :
And how do we live this life?
KUNAL SHAH :
We are playing life on extremely hard mode if you don't learn human behavior.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I would say that's one thing.
KUNAL SHAH :
The second thing, evolutionary biology, teaches a lot about how species evolve and how they make decisions and what are the core motivations that drive everybody.
KUNAL SHAH :
So that's another one I would recommend.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I don't want to make a recommendation because I can barely finish a book to be honest.
KUNAL SHAH :
So I believe in drifting and getting deeper into topics.
KUNAL SHAH :
So understanding the topics versus trying to say, give me these three books and I'm going to be good.
KUNAL SHAH :
And the last one I would say, is that anything that can make you learn something about their journey versus their success.
KUNAL SHAH :
So sometimes autobiographies are too celebratory in some ways, but if you can just kind of understand how… any book that can teach you about how people recover from a setback in great detail is a great book to learn from.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
An audience member on Twitter actually asked a similar question along these lines, if there's one book that you could read over and over and over, what would that be?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Is there one?
KUNAL SHAH :
I absolutely don't believe in reading over and over because I believe that we are evolving.
KUNAL SHAH :
You might discover the same stuff coming from different books and you would say, "Oh, I can categorize this in my brain again and again."
KUNAL SHAH :
But I think we tend to become believers, and it becomes too religious if you repeat.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Yeah.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
KUNAL SHAH :
I love Oppenheimer because of the struggles and Nolan's craft of making the movies, but nothing in the recent past that I feel is right up there.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?
KUNAL SHAH :
I like to ask a hypothetical second order thinking question.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, if everybody who has taken a COVID vaccine dies tonight, what happens in 12 months from now?
KUNAL SHAH :
Can you explain the world- from what happens to money, what happens to law?
KUNAL SHAH :
What happens to countries?
KUNAL SHAH :
What happens to the military?
KUNAL SHAH :
What happens to the stock market?
KUNAL SHAH :
What happens to the order of things?
KUNAL SHAH :
And I would say less than 10% of really smart people can have really good answers.
KUNAL SHAH :
So it tells you how good they are at second order thinking.
KUNAL SHAH :
But the questions can keep changing.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, if you said that, what if arranged marriages were banned in India, and you got capital punishment for doing arranged marriages?
KUNAL SHAH :
What happens to the country?
KUNAL SHAH :
How do we change from there?
KUNAL SHAH :
Like some absurd scenarios, but then what happens after that?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Not to give away your secret sauce, but what do you look for in an answer that gives you a sense there?
KUNAL SHAH :
The range of things that they could go into and think about- if this happens, B happens and then C happens.
KUNAL SHAH :
The leaps they could make.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And just so people understand, when you're talking about second order thinking, what's the simplest way to describe that concept?
KUNAL SHAH :
I think the simplest way to think about this is being able to correctly judge the butterfly effect of an event as close as possible.
KUNAL SHAH :
For example, a lot of people in the stock market use that to say how stocks will go up and down.
KUNAL SHAH :
There's something that has happened in the market.
KUNAL SHAH :
“Oh, there is a war now with Russia, then what happens to the market?”
KUNAL SHAH :
Can you be good at predicting that?
KUNAL SHAH :
But in everything in life, if this happens, a lot of people hate this because it's very taxing to the brain.
KUNAL SHAH :
The brain absolutely hates second order thinking unless you've trained your brain with second order thinking all the time that it looks forward to it.
KUNAL SHAH :
So you convert this into a hate versus a reward cycle, and that comes with probably doing it early on in your life.
KUNAL SHAH :
Later on, people hate doing second order thinking.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
It is.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Yes.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
That sounds like a lot of work for the brain.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Okay.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Just a few more questions.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered and that you really love?
KUNAL SHAH :
I'm looking forward to my Vision Pro coming soon.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
It's a future favorite product.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
We have actually Boz from Meta coming on as the next guest in my recording.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I'm not sure when they come out in sequence, but we're going to talk about his thoughts.
KUNAL SHAH :
The most fascinating thing that I saw was Zuck talking about the utility of Meta being better than Vision Pro and their product.
KUNAL SHAH :
And that's exactly going to work well for Apple because when you try to make the product more utilitarian, it loses status.
KUNAL SHAH :
And if you study animals, you realize that the one which gets the highest mating success is the one which can demonstrate the ability to waste resources and not be very efficient with resources.
KUNAL SHAH :
And therefore people who are known to buy a product that is wasteful will actually own higher status.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I think Zuck made it actually quite easy for Apple to demonstrate their superior positioning by saying that, "Oh, we are not as efficient, we are not as cheap.
KUNAL SHAH :
We are not for everybody."
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Wow.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Just continue to blow minds even on our lightning round.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends and family, find useful in work or in life?
KUNAL SHAH :
It's not a favorite motto, but I think we truly are transient and we are very lucky to have this life that we have and we have to make the most out of it.
KUNAL SHAH :
And all these struggles will mean nothing.
KUNAL SHAH :
I often tell people that you should wish for your life to be so great that you have collected the highest amount of content when you are old, and you have no end to the stories that you can talk about.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
That reminds me of a book I once read that really had an impact on me where somebody was trying to make a movie of their life and the producer was like, "There's nothing.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
There's no good movie here.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
You have not done enough interesting things."
KUNAL SHAH :
I love it.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And so he turned his lens of what to do in life, by thinking what would make a great story.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And so he just started to do a a great story, something where you overcome challenges and achieve something you wanted.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And so that became his life motto.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
“I'm going to try hard things and overcome them.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And that's going to be my life.”
KUNAL SHAH :
I love it.
KUNAL SHAH :
I love it.
KUNAL SHAH :
I love it.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I'll link to that book in the show notes.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Final question, do you have this series on Twitter that you call Monday Motivations?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
I'm curious what's motivating you these days?
KUNAL SHAH :
I find the internet is filled with all these people trying to give fake motivation and make money off that stuff.
KUNAL SHAH :
And it's almost like a drug for people to feel, ”Oh my God, there's motivation, I'm going to do well.”
KUNAL SHAH :
I just wanted to remind people that all success comes from an extraordinary amount of pain and struggle and hard work, and there is no shortcut to anything material coming in life.
KUNAL SHAH :
And so the Monday motivation post comes as the anti-motivation post because the world is filled with... I believe that the biggest profit making scheme that I've seen in recent times is to tell people to love themselves and they'll pay you money for saying that.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I think the best way to love yourself is to keep evolving.
KUNAL SHAH :
So my motivation comes from evolution, connecting dots, solving harder problems than I've solved in the past.
KUNAL SHAH :
And I think life is ultimately a game where you want to feel that your levels have changed and your skills have changed constantly.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Kunal, you are wonderful.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Thank you so much for being here.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Two final questions.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on some of this stuff?
LENNY RACHITSKY :
And how can listeners be useful to you?
KUNAL SHAH :
You can find me on social media.
KUNAL SHAH :
Look for Kunal Shah, you'll find me everywhere.
KUNAL SHAH :
I usually have a different personality on each social media.
KUNAL SHAH :
And in terms of being helpful, keep tagging me on interesting things that you discover that gave you that moment of, ”Oh my God, I did not know this.”
KUNAL SHAH :
I would love that.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Amazing.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Kunal, again, thank you so much for being here.
KUNAL SHAH :
Thank you so much for having me.
LENNY RACHITSKY :
Bye everyone.
