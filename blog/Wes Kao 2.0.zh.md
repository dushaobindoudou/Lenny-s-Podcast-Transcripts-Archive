**... recommendation in context. And realize that it's not just I'm the only one who cares about this company. Everyone is a hypocrite. They say they believe this, but don't actually want to work on it. Before that was kind of her narrative, but once she zoomed out and realized she was being a single [inaudible 00**:

48:16], she could better fit her proposal in the context of what else was happening in the organization. I think actually this is a really big difference between more junior people versus more senior people. More junior people are like, "I need to win. I need to get a yes for this proposal and I'm going to keep advocating for it until I get a yes." Whereas really sometimes the best decision for the company is not right now. This doesn't actually fit our priorities right now, right?
:
Or maybe yes, but let's right size the level of investment. So it might look like half whatever the size of what that recommendation actually was, and having the maturity to realize that, to put your idea into context is huge. That took me a really long time to learn and I think that goes under the umbrella of always do what's best for the company, not necessarily what's best for me, my career, my team, my wins. If you prioritize what's best for the company, that helps you have a more right-sized way of still advocating for your ideas, but doing it with a bit more equanimity.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And also just connecting to what the company is. Just this idea of if the thing you're pitching is not aligned with what is important to the company right now, it's unlikely to be prioritized. It makes sense. This is why leaders choose, here's what matters most. We got to do the things that are going to help us drive this thing right now, like retention or revenue. And so that's just, I think, a sub tactic there is just whenever you're pitching something, connect that to the goal of the person you're pitching to so that they're like, "Oh, I see how this is going to help me. That's great. Let's do it. Great advice."
:
And I think this is something a lot of people run into. It's just, "Why aren't they listening to me? Why don't they want... That's such a good idea. They hate me." It's something, "Oh, I bet they hate me. They don't trust me." When it's just like, okay, this isn't a priority right now. Let's come back to it another time. Okay. I'm going to get to a couple more tactics and then I'm going to shift directions to talk about managers and being manager. You have an awesome framework called MOO. What is MOO? What does it stand for and what is it all about?
Wes Kao :
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. M-O-O. And the thought there is that a lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get, especially in meetings where we feel blindsided, that was unexpected, and then we're on our back foot. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get when I share this, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. So are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely. And so this is where knowing your own argument in and out, including counterarguments becomes so important. So knowing your counterarguments as well as you know the arguments for doing the thing. When you do that, when you have prepared in that way, you're less likely to feel caught off guard.
Lenny Rachitsky :
When you hear you talk about this, it's like, obviously I shouldn't do this, but very few people actually do this, actually spend a couple minutes, " Okay, here's what I'm going to pitch."
Wes Kao :
Even a couple seconds, really. Really, even a couple seconds, your brain will think of something.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Is there a story or an example of this that you share that highlights this idea of the power of MOO?
Wes Kao :
I use MOO multiple times a day, every day, every single day. Literally whatever I'm about to say I think how might someone disagree with this or what might an objection be? So whatever it is I'm writing, saying, it's a really good mental filter because it encourages you to think a couple steps ahead in kind of a structured way, right? If I'm about to say this, the person may then say this to me. Well, if I take that into account, I can volunteer that information upfront or I can frame it in a way where they're less likely to think that that's an issue.
:
And so it's muscle memory for me at this point, and this might be something we include at the end is something to start with. But putting MOO on a post-it, Most Obvious Objection, what is someone likely to object about? And then just keeping that top of mind. It's a great way to train yourself to empathize with your audience and with your recipient. We all say that and we all know we should do it, but for me this is a really tactical concrete way to do it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think what's great about a lot of the tactics you're sharing is not only is it going to help you communicate it better, but it helps you actually think and crystallize it better for yourself because you may realize, oh, that's a really good objection. Like, oh, the objection's probably going to be this. Will it drive enough impact for the business? Oh, that's a great point. Maybe I should not pitch this right now.
Wes Kao :
Yeah. It definitely helps shape your own thinking. I think communication and thinking are so much more interrelated than we think. I think people think there's a thinking as phase one and then communicating the thinking, and the reality is a lot more intertwined. And I loved your example there that thinking ahead to what might be the most obvious objection actually then prompts you to realize that maybe there was a gap in what you were planning to present and then you now have an opportunity to strengthen that pitch before you say it out loud.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There's a quote I have highlighted on this podcast a number of times that I love that is exactly along these lines by Joan Didion. "I don't know what I think until I write it down." I know exactly that feeling. Okay. So there's a couple more things that people have shared that you are amazing at helping them get better at. One is just keeping your cool and staying calm during very high stakes, real-time conversations when things maybe aren't going your way or if you disagree with someone, any advice on that, it feels like you're really good at this.
Wes Kao :
I think one thing that tends to throw people off is putting a lot of pressure on themselves to get the exact right answer. So if they are asked a question and they don't know the answer, a lot of people will then kind of freak out. And I was taught early in my career that if you don't know the answer, you should say, "Let me look into it, I'll get back to you." So that's a fine approach. It's definitely better than making something up, right? So definitely don't make something up. But if you are more experienced and have some confidence in your subject matter area, just saying I'll get back to you, is sometimes a missed opportunity. You can ask for a bit more information to be able to continue the conversation in that moment. So let's say that your exec says what percentage of users came from mobile last month and you don't have that number off the top of your head.
:
So person A says, "Let me look into it and I'll get back to you." Person B might say, "I don't have that number off the top of my head, but in the last quarter the number has been 60 to 70% and it's grown in the past year, so mobile is now a bigger part of our business, et cetera. Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately or where's that commission coming from, basically? Right? And so being able to answer a similar question in the direction you think the person is asking about and then validating why they're asking that question allows you to still continue that conversation in the moment. I call it the question behind the question, sometimes you get a question, but underneath there's a deeper underlying concern.
:
And many times people don't even know that it's there, right? Subconscious. So it's not nefarious, they're not withholding anything from you. But when you are explaining something and you're kind of getting multiple questions on the same thing, it's a good sign that there might be a deeper question behind the question and it's our responsibility to figure out what might that be. And so probing, asking for a bit more information, answering in that general direction and then validating these are all techniques you can use when you are in the moment without feeling like, oh, I must have every single thing prepared and the moment that I'm caught off guard, everything goes to shit.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Another tactic along these lines that's very similar to what you're describing, but I'll share that I learned that was really helpful is just if you're not sure what to say, basically just reflecting back their question and just being like, let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for. You want to understand monthly retention for, and then maybe clarify. And that one gives you time to think about it as you're talking. Two, it helps the person recognize, "Oh, he hears me. Great. Okay, this is good. He's thinking about this." And then at the end of that you could be like, "Okay. I don't actually have that specific number. Let me think about it." Or, "I have the quarterly number. Okay. That's what I know." So there's an interim step almost that I'll add into your piece of advice of just reflect back their question, just better understand what they're looking for.
Wes Kao :
Yeah, I love that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Okay, let's go back to what I said we do. Let's pick one tactic that you think people should try first, maybe one or two. So let me read the ones we've gone through and then see what you think would be a good first step. So one is starting with sales, before getting to logistics and giving people the why signposting using specific words to help people guide the doc and not get overwhelmed. Finding the right level of confidence, having a POV, that sort of thing. Getting better, being concise, MOO, not overusing formatting, something else you shared. And then this idea of when you don't know the answer, not saying I'll get back to you as the default, maybe giving them a different answer, maybe asking them more questions. Across those, which do you think someone should try to like, "Okay. Let me start here."
Wes Kao :
I would start with Most Obvious Objection and also framing your conversation up front. And that kind of relates to using signposting words if needed to help you frame that conversation.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Sweet. That's such an easy one to remember. Just MOO. Okay. So stick a post it somewhere when you're about to share something in Slack and ask someone for something, present in a meeting, send a strategy, and just think about for a few seconds what might be the most obvious objection to what I'm trying to ask them to do. Great. Okay. So let's talk about management. And there's kind of two sides to it. Being a manager and being a person reporting to a manager, you have a bunch of really good advice here. One is there around managing up. One of my most popular posts in the early days was advice for managing up and just how important it is. What advice do you have for someone to get better at managing up? Why is that even so important? Why do you think people may be under appreciating how important it is to manage your manager, let's say.
Wes Kao :
One of the most common myths about managing up that I definitely felt early on in my career was that I would have to manage up if I were more junior, but eventually I would outgrow it, that I would get senior enough that I would no longer have to do it. And it was a rude awakening that no matter how senior I got, managing up, I not only had to manage up, it actually became more important. So I think managing up is one of those skills that if you invest in learning it, it serves you now and for the rest of your career. And I realize that many senior people are actually the best at managing up. That's partially how they got to be so senior in the first place. But also, the more senior you get, the less likely that your manager is going to give you really well-defined tasks and problems on a silver platter and ask you to solve them.
:
You are going to be dealing with more ambiguity and you're going to be dealing with sometimes a mandate like make this number go up or create this division, right? Where you need to manage up and make sure that your leader, your manager, is in the loop about what you are about to try and what you're about to do and make sure that they're aligned. And so for me, realizing that managing up is something that is ongoing and that it shifts and evolves and looks different as you go in your career, that was a big unlock for me.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just that even if you become even a VP, if you become a director and still something you want to invest in, any specific tactic or advice for how to manage up well.
Wes Kao :
The biggest one is to share your point of view. So this some people are surprised by because they think I'm going to say do a weekly recap of the tasks that you worked on or what you contributed. And that is a good idea, if you want to do it, you can do it. But I think the more highly leveraged way to contribute and manage up is by being more vocal about sharing your point of view. When you just ask your manager, "Hey manager, what should we do?" You're putting a lot of cognitive load on your manager to need to think about the problem, think about potential solutions, craft the solution, and then tell you what to do. Whereas if you instead said, "Hey manager, here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" You give them something to build off of and that reduces the amount of mental lift that they have to put forth.
:
And so sharing your point of view more readily, backing it up with evidence, that's a wonderful way of making your manager's life easier. And also showing that you are an active rigorous thinker who is thinking strategically about the business. You're not just waiting to be told what to do, you're not expecting them to figure things out and then tell you you are actively looking around the corner trying to solve problems, forming hypotheses in your mind, observing and noticing things. And again, sharing your point of view doesn't mean that you have the perfect answer. You can share that, "Hey, I've noticed this problem popping up in a couple of different places. Here's what I think might be happening."
:
Or when you share a report, don't only share the report and expect your manager to come up with insights and takeaways. You should look at the report too and point out insights and takeaways. So it's really changing that posture from more reactive and more waiting to be told what to do or kind of staying in this narrow box to being willing to share your recommendation, your point of view, share what you're noticing, and this is something that even junior people could do.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I was going to say exactly that. I think not only is it something junior people can do, this is a really good way to get promoted and to take on more leadership opportunities. You coming to your manager with, "Here's something I think we should do. Here's a perspective I have. Here's an opportunity." If you were in charge, you're like, how awesome would it be for people to come to me with amazing ideas and have clear recommendations? That sounds great. Everyone wants that. So if you can do that, amazing. Who wouldn't want that? But then what's interesting is similar to how writing helps you crystallize your thinking, you coming in with a recommendation forces you to really think deeply about it because that's putting your reputation on the line. So there's a second order effect of it makes you actually spend more time on the thing and be clear about why you think this is a good idea and do more research. So a lot of wins here.
Wes Kao :
There are a lot of situations where you might have the most visibility into a problem. You might have the most proximity into an issue. And so if you're not speaking up about it and sharing what you're observing, sharing what you're noticing, your manager doesn't necessarily have visibility into that. And so I've heard so many managers say that they want their junior people to speak up more because their junior people have often close contact with customers, with support tickets, with cleaning data, with a bunch of things where the manager would love to hear insights from that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
If you're not having success with this, if you're hearing this and be like, but it never worked, my manager doesn't listen to me, listen to the rest of this podcast we just did, which is basically advice on how to effectively convince someone of a thing. It's like, tell them why this is a problem, be really concise about it, sign post words, all these things. That's exactly what this whole conversation's been about. Okay. Let's see. We have a couple more really cool tactics that people have suggested we talk about. One is how to give feedback well, how to do better, how to be more effective at giving feedback. What's your advice there?
Wes Kao :
I have a framework called strategy, not self-expression. And so the idea here is that most of the time, by the time we are giving feedback to someone, we have been frustrated for a while. I used to be very conflict diverse, so I would wait and try to convince myself that I wasn't bothered by something until I really couldn't hold it in anymore. Then I would schedule a one-on-one with a coworker to tell them the feedback and it would inevitably turn into a venting session where I was in the name of sharing the impact of what they did would share all my frustrations and all the ways that they have basically harmed me and made my life difficult. And this would be very counterproductive because the person would either feel like and feel really demoralized or they'd get really defensive and they'd want to argue with me about how what they did actually was not that bad or it was partially my fault too or whatever.
:
And so I realized that a better way of giving feedback is thinking about motivating the person's behavior change. The goal is behavior change. So if that's the goal, trim everything else that you were about to say that does not actually contribute to that goal and only keep the part that will make the person want to change, help them understand the benefit to them as well as to the people around them. And so usually for me, that's trimming 90% of the initial stuff that I want to say and really keeping only that 10%. And that's made a really big difference. Whenever I am giving constructive feedback of any kind, I always keep that in mind. And when I don't do it, I almost always regret it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Someone close to me in my life is working on the skill, which is there's just, "I want people to know how they messed up. Justice. I need this to be fair." And what I always recommend is just think about what you want to get out of this conversation, what do you want from them? And then, okay, what's the best way to get that? Versus just making sure they hear you and making sure they understand how screwed up this was. And that's basically what you're saying is focus on the outcome you want to achieve, not something that's useful, something that will make you just feel better.
Wes Kao :
Yeah. I definitely think that having a space to vent and to share those frustrations is important. So you want to get that out before you go into the conversation with your counterpart. So whether it's talking to your therapist or your partner or friend, you want to basically get all that energy out because otherwise you bring it into the conversation and it doesn't take much to set you off. You might have a whole script, you're controlled, you're calm, and then you start talking and the other person raises an eyebrow and is acting a little incredulous at what you're saying, and that's all it takes for you to snap and be like, "You're surprised? You're incredulous? Why are you incredulous?" Right? And then you're off, right? Yeah. Getting that energy out, I would say step one, so that you can go into the conversation clear, grounded, setting that emotional tone that is more positive and that allows you to stay focused on only the part that will get them to behave in the way you want them to behave.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Such good advice. And I think we come back to are you getting the outcomes you want? If you're not, this is another reason it might be the case is you just need them to hear your mind. I just need you to know. And I think a lesson here is that may not be the best path to getting what you want, but it may feel good. Maybe people are like, "Ah, but I really want them to know this."
Wes Kao :
There's that great Einstein quote about insanity being repeating things that you're doing expecting a different outcome. And I feel like that applies so much to the workplace and to communication. Most of us have certain patterns that we are used to and certain ways of responding, and if you believe that there is untapped upside that whatever you are at is kind of a local maximum and that there's better out there, then that's where switching things up could be useful and not just doing everything that you've been doing and getting the same result that you might be getting.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This resonates with Toby Lutke when he is doing the podcast, talked about how... He had this quote that I love that just "No human in history has come anywhere near their potential and everyone is way, way, way better than they think are," and these are really cool tactics and really effective ways to actually get closer to your potential. Okay. Two more things I want to talk about real quick. One is your advice on delegating, but also continuing to have high standards. This is something I spent a lot of time on because a lot of people don't delegate because they're afraid it's not going to be as great. I just want this to be really good. I don't trust that it's going to go as well. If I did it my way, it'd be great. So just advice on how to delegate effectively while maintaining high standards.
Wes Kao :
Yeah. I have a framework called CEDAF. C-E-D-A-F.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Mm-hmm. I love all these acronyms.
Wes Kao :
It's kind of like Cedar, but with an F at the end. I need acronyms for myself. All of these are really reminders for myself because I need a short way to remind myself. So CEDAF stands for the C is comprehension. So have I given this person that I'm delegating to everything that they need to understand what it is that I want them to do. That includes more simple things like logins to all the right software tools that they need to look up, whatever you need to look up. And understanding what the end result should look like, right? So that's all under C for comprehension. E is excitement. Am I explaining this in a way that is making this as exciting as it could be? There are a lot of tasks that aren't inherently that exciting, but by explaining the why behind we're doing this or why it's important to the project we're working on, that makes people more likely to understand and be excited about how this fits into everything.
:
So E is for excitement. D is for de-risk. Am I de-risking any obvious risks from delegating this? So usually when I ask clients this, they immediately think of something. They're like, "Oh yeah, I wouldn't want my direct report to spend a ton of time going in the wrong direction, filling out a hundred rows of the spreadsheet if actually it took longer than we expected." Okay, great. If that's a risk, then maybe you have them do 10 rows, see how long it takes, see if we need all the information that they're actually gathering, and then regroup, right? So what's an obvious risk? Another might be I can see this person misunderstanding and thinking I'm looking for this where I'm really looking for that. Okay, perfect. Just tell them, "When I explain this, you might think I mean this, but really I don't want that. I actually want this," right? So just vocalize it. The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to-
Wes Kao :
The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to speak up and make sure we are actually aligned, that they're picking up what I'm putting down? Because you might be explaining a bunch of stuff, but how much are they actually absorbing? You won't ever know if you wrap up your little spiel and then say, "Okay, go off. Come back to me when you're done." So give people a chance to ask questions to see what parts are resonating, what parts they might be a little bit confused on. Usually, when I do this, it's amazing. Because my team member will say, "What did you mean by this part? How does this part fit in?" I'm like, "Oh my God, I totally forgot to mention this thing." Or, "Oh yeah, I didn't even really explain that well." Okay, so let's go into that.
:
And then F is feedback. How can you have the shortest feedback loop possible? I am a huge fan of shorting the feedback loop as much as possible and then shortening it again. So even within that initial conversation where I'm delegating something, instead of waiting a week, what if we waited a day and checked in on the initial direction that person was going? And let's do it even more. What if after I finished explaining, at the end of that conversation, we brainstormed a couple things that, that person wants to do? So within this same conversation, I'm delegating, I'm already getting a sense of, where do you want to go with this? Once you start, do you see any bottlenecks?
:
And so just really keeping that feedback loop super tight. I found that when I run through the CDAP acronym, there's usually one letter that I could amp up a little bit more like, oh, I didn't really put much thought into making this exciting for the person. How can I connect this to their career goals or to the company's priorities this quarter or to something else? So it's a nice mental checklist.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So much of your advice comes back to this idea that we've touched on a couple of times. We just spend a little bit more time upfront. Is that how you described it, a little more time upfront?
Wes Kao :
Yeah, a little bit more time. A little bit more of an investment upfront.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Upfront to save you tons of time later. Okay. So as you described this, I don't know if you're realizing this, but you're basically just helping people work better with AI and agents. This framework is exactly I think what people need to effectively delegate to this future world of this agent world of society of agents doing work for us. Basically, you're going to be delegating to these agents in the future, and this framework is a really cool way to frame it. So think about it. Am I communicating this well, comprehension? So CDAP. Comprehension is, again, can I make this clear? Is that the way to think about that?
Wes Kao :
Yeah. Can I make this clear? Does this person have everything they need to be able to accomplish what I am asking them to do?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. And then it's communicate why you're excited about this, basically the why. And it's interesting, there's this funny prompt technique I've learned, prompting engineering technique of just telling the AI, "This is very important to my job." Just using that sentence, it does it better.
Wes Kao :
Oh, interesting, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It takes it more seriously. It's just so weird. I have a post about this, and that's one of the pieces of advice, just tell me why this is important. I think people take it to the extreme as someone will die if you don't get this right. That actually works.
Wes Kao :
That is extreme. Cool.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's wild. Okay, so CEDF, comprehension, excited, de-risk, think about ways you can de-risk, which is moot, basically. What's the most? It's a similar concept. Just think ahead to what might go wrong. Make sure you're aligned, which is quite important in the AI space. Make sure you're aligned. And feedback, get a quick feedback cycle. And it's interesting with deep research on some of these AI tools now, it's like, "I'm off for half an hour. See you." And I imagine more and more of them will check in with you as it's going and ask you questions. I used deep research recently and it's really good at just like, okay, let me have five questions for you before I go off and do this work just to clarify what you want.
Wes Kao :
Yeah, I found that AI will often shorten the feedback loop and align with you as well. When you prompt it, when it comes back, it will not do the entire task for me, sometimes. It'll say, "I've done the first part of this. Does this sound right? Is this what you're looking for? If so, I will complete the next section." And then sometimes I'm like, "Do the whole thing. Just stop trying to conserve energy and just do. I want you to do the whole thing." But that's what it's doing, it's breaking it into smaller chunks to de-risk that it's going to use all this bandwidth to process this thing and I'm going to say, "Oh, that's not what I was looking for."
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm going to come back to AI real quick, but before I do that, I have one more question for you, but let me just say, I feel like we've discovered an AI version of your course now. Basically, how to delegate well to AI agents that I think people are going to find really valuable, planting a seed. Okay. Before we get back to AI, you have this other concept that I love that I actually learned from you years ago when I was working on my course called the swipe file. Swipe file, what is a swipe file? What is that about? What can it help you with? Why should people be doing this?
Wes Kao :
Yeah. So swipe files are really common for marketers, and I think other functions haven't caught on as much, but I think it is really, really useful. And basically a swipe file is collecting inspiration that you can refer back to later on. So some marketers will collect examples of copy, landing pages, ads, et cetera. For me, I have a file, an Apple Notes, file called Smart Things People Have Said, where I will basically paste in phrases, words, things people have said that I thought were well articulated or sounded really intelligent or sounded strategic. And I don't actually go back and look through my swipe file very often, I think other people do, but for me, even the act of adding it to my swipe file, I've already gotten value from it because it's training me to be more alert to noticing when something is working well.
:
I think there's so much happening around us all the time that your coworker says something smart and you're like, "Oh, that was nice," and then you keep moving on. But when you stop and pause and think, oh, that was really effective, let me add it to my file, and also think about, why was that effective and is that something I can borrow? So in my course, I encourage folks to create a work journal where they can jot down some of these observations, some of these phrases, and basically encourage yourself to be more alert to things you can borrow from other people all around you.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Something else about the swipe file, you use quotes. It could be screenshots of cool designs. It could be strategy docs you found to be really effective. It could be conversion flows that are really cool. It could be just whatever you're interested in.
Wes Kao :
Yeah. And the great thing about that is you can then go back and analyze it and break down the structure, break down the argument, break down why was this so effective? Whereas if you're not capturing it, it's easy to just move on to the next thing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, cool. And I did this for a while. I stopped, to be honest, but I really want to be doing this. So this is maybe some homework or something, because I know a lot of people stick with it, is just start like a folder or a Notes, note, whatever you use for your note-taking, and just start throwing stuff in there. And it could be messy, right? It's just like, throw it in.
Wes Kao :
It can be super messy. I was going to say, my back end system is super messy and it's fine. It's not a problem I need to be solving. It works. I find things I need to find. So I like having as simple of a process as possible. So Apple Notes, I open it. It's just on my home screen, I just add something. I'm not tagging anything, I'm not putting it in certain rows and filling information out. I'm just including it in a file, and if I want to go back and look at it, it served its purpose.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. Okay, so last question. AI, I'm going to just come back to this briefly. We have this segment on the podcast called AI Corner, and we touched on this already, but I'm just curious how you have found AI to be useful in your work or your life, whether it's helped you become a better communicator? Is there anything you can share that might be helpful to folks?
Wes Kao :
Yeah. I love Claude. There are days when I talk to Claude for three or four hours prompting as a thought partner. So yeah, I think that AI is really helpful for an initial draft of something to bounce off of. Sometimes I'll paste in an email that I am not quite sure how to respond to and ask Claude, "Tell me draft reply." And I'll usually give it some direction. So I found that sharing my point of view makes the output way better. If I just give it something and say, "What would you say?" It's just not as good. Whereas if I say, "I am not sure about how to tell this person no, because I previously said yes and so I feel on the hook, but history has changed and so is there a nice way where I can be really respectful of our relationship and also make them feel seen and heard, but decline?"
:
So if I explain, "That's the problem I'm dealing with and here's what I would ideally like to be able to do," Claude comes back to something that's pretty good. And then from there I'll edit it to my voice because usually it's a little bit too formal sounding. And so I'll make some edits and then I'll share it back to Claude and say, "What do you think of this version? Would you make any improvements?" And then we go back and forth from there.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wes, this is the most useful thing I've ever heard.
Wes Kao :

**[inaudible 01**:

21:44].
Lenny Rachitsky :
I need this and I need this immediately, just nice ways to say no to stuff. This needs to be an extension that I can have in my browser, just, "Help me say no to this, please." Wow, such a great idea. Okay, good one. Okay, great. Wes, is there anything else? We've gone through a lot. I imagine the answer is no, but before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?
Wes Kao :
No, I feel like we covered a bunch of great frameworks, principles, so lots for folks to get started.
Lenny Rachitsky :
All the things. And I love that so much of this will apply to being more effective with AI tools and I feel like people can go through this again and just through that lens of, how will this helped me get more out of Claude and ChatGPT? I bet so much of this will actually apply and I feel like there's an interesting course there. With that, Wes, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
Wes Kao :
All right,
Lenny Rachitsky :
Are you ready?
Wes Kao :
Let's do it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay. First question, what are a couple books that you recommend most to other people?
Wes Kao :
One is High Output Management by Andy Grove, which is a classic. Another one is Your Brain At Work by Dr. David Rock. And that one is all about better understanding your own brain and attention span so that you can allocate your mental resources appropriately. So that one's great. Ever since reading that, I hide my phone from view because there have been studies that show that even seeing your phone in the corner of your eye, it's distracting. And I do the hardest things earlier in the day when you have more cognitive resources available. So that one's really good. Yeah, those two.
Lenny Rachitsky :
These are great. I completely get that phone thing. I'm just looking at my phone, I'm like, "Dang, get out of here. Just go away."
Wes Kao :
I will stick it under my pillow on the couch or hide it under a notebook. It's huge. I'm always hiding my phone so it's not in my line of sight.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I think Arianna Huffington has a product you can buy that's a little bed for your phone that you put to bed before you go to bed in a different room and it has a charger attached.
Wes Kao :
Oh, that's cute.
Lenny Rachitsky :
So cute, so cute.
Wes Kao :
I don't know if I need a separate bed for my phone.
Lenny Rachitsky :
But it's like a ritual, I guess, and there's some theory behind it. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
Wes Kao :
I love Anything by Harlan Coben on Netflix. Basically, I don't even remember any specific movies or a TV series, but anything he puts out, he's an author and then they've turned a lot of his books into mystery thriller TV series, and anything he puts out becomes number one on Netflix. And I appreciate that he gives the people what they want, that he knows his craft, he knows his genre. And yeah, he just has so many bangers. And I don't remember any specific one, but if it's a Harlan Coben show, I know it's going to be good.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I'm looking at a list now I just Googled real quick. So it's all scary stuff, right?
Wes Kao :
Yeah, they're mystery thrillers, and I think he does a good job playing with time and revealing information over time. It's usually something about someone's past that is now coming to haunt them, and so he'll skip between present day to the past and then slowly reveal stuff. And there's always a twist at the end.
Lenny Rachitsky :
There's a page, the Harlan Coben Collection on Netflix. That we'll link to that has all this stuff. I've never heard of this, so this is great. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?
Wes Kao :
I recently started using an electric toothbrush and it's been life-changing. So my husband got one and then a couple weeks later he gifted me one, and I was like, "Wow, this is actually really nice."
Lenny Rachitsky :
Are you a Sonicare person, Oral-B person, or something else?
Wes Kao :
It's Oral-B but I've not tried any other brand. That was one that our dentist gifted my husband this electric toothbrush because he did Invisalign. And I'm sure Invisalign is every dentist's dream.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Margins.
Wes Kao :
I feel like every time I get a cleaning, the dentist is like, "So have you thought about, are you interested in Invisalign?" I'm like, "No." And so when they get a yes, I'm sure they're really excited, and then they lock you in, the brand locks you in with these replacement toothbrush heads that are way more expensive than they should be. So it's a whole razor and blades, ink cartridge and printer model here. So I was horrified by how expensive these replacement heads were.
Lenny Rachitsky :
But you got a free toothbrush. I think the Oral-B is what I use, but I think that's what the Wirecutter recommended, but it's so loud. I don't know. One of them is just really loud. I think it's the Oral-B, but it's better, apparently. I went with Wirecutter, but it's so loud. I feel like there needs to be a Wirecutter for good design and experience...
Wes Kao :
Ooh.
Lenny Rachitsky :
... versus just the optimal efficient version. Anyway, let's keep going. Do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you repeat yourself and share with folks?
Wes Kao :
Yes. I actually have many, but I'll share two. One is everything takes longer than you think. So this applies whether you are calling customer support for something or running an errand or building your career, building skills. I find it's useful to add buffers for yourself. This applies for launches too. Just assume it will take longer than you think and you'll be less stressed.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That connects to everything we've been talking about. Just spend a little more time upfront to make it. And maybe if you spend more time front, it'll take less time than you think.
Wes Kao :
The other one is a riff on always be closing, like Glengarry Ross. "It's always be selling." This does not mean pawning your wares, but rather putting forth effort into convincing the other person of whatever your recommendation is.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Love them. Okay, final question. So you've been a long time, I hate this word operator, but I guess that's the way people describe this, where you've just been working at companies, building companies, and you recently left that just to become creative person. Started a course on Maven. You do executive coaching, things like that. Any just lessons or a lesson from that jump that might be helpful to folks that are maybe thinking about that?
Wes Kao :
I think when you are an in-house operator, there's a lot about your role that you have a little bit less control over, basically. There's just certain things you have to do because it comes with the territory. Whereas when you are a solo operator running your own business, doing your own thing, you have a lot of freedom to craft your work around only your strengths, only the part that you are really good at, that adds a lot of value for other people where there's market demand. And so, for me, there was a bit of a shift where when I realized that I could craft my business, my work around only the part that I'm best at, and that can be a narrow-ass slice, that's actually really, really freeing.
:
And so I would encourage folks to think about, what is the thing that you are extremely good at that people find super valuable, the part that you love doing most, if you could not do all the other stuff you don't want to do, and how can you think about doubling down on that?
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's such an important point. And the Claude tip you shared of how to say no well is such an important ingredient into that, because so many things come at you and are interesting and enticing that it's hard to decline, that you realize, why the hell am I doing this? I can actually control where I spend time and why did I say yes to this?
Wes Kao :
I actually credit you with helping me come to this realization. I mentioned you on a podcast the other day about this because, do you remember when Maven was launching an important feature, I think it was our marketplace or something, and I had asked you if you wanted to go on Clubhouse to be part of the launch?
Lenny Rachitsky :
I remember that, but I am sure I said no.
Wes Kao :
Okay, yeah. You said no. You said no. And I was like, "Wow. Out of curiosity, what's the thought behind it?" And you said, I'm going to bastardize this, you could correct me, but you essentially said, "I don't really like doing live public speaking type things and I've been fortunate enough to build a career where I can write, I do my podcasts, and work only on the part that I love doing. And so I'm okay saying no to these other really interesting opportunities." And I remember at that time thinking it was so groundbreaking that you could say no to something that was legitimately a cool opportunity and be really confident about it because it wasn't your core competency. It wasn't the thing you are best at. And I've really kept that in mind when opportunities come my way of, am I excited about this? Is this what I'm really good at? Can I shine in this setting? Because when you are solo, you get to choose the settings that you want to be in.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's such a cool story. I don't exactly remember that, but I am zero surprised at what I said. And the way I put it now, when folks invite me to stuff like this is I just find the ROI on my time is so not worth doing a talk, doing a fireside thing, doing another podcast. It's just like, if I can spend more time on this newsletter than the podcast, the leverage is so much higher than just doing a talk because that takes so much time. So I just have this template now that basically says what I sent you, that is, that it helps. But it's tough. It's so hard to say no. Sometimes these opportunities are so interesting and the person is like, "Wait, what?"
:
Because I don't think the people asking you for stuff know that I'm getting 10 of them a day, and they're like, "Oh, he said no to my talk. He doesn't want to be on my podcast. What a jerk." That's what I think. I don't know if that's what they think. But anyway. Okay, that's great. Yes, and I think I just had a post about reaching a million subscribers to the newsletter, and actually had this image of the Ikigai concept, which is exactly what you just described, which is you want to try to find the thing that you love doing, that people value, and that you can make money doing. That's the dream. And that's exactly what you have done as well. So thank you for being here, Wes. I actually think we delivered on what I thought we would. I think this is going to be one of the most highest leverage conversations we've had.
:
So two final questions. Where can folks find your course? I know you also do executive coaching. Where can folks learn more? And final question is just, how can folks be useful to you, Wes?
Wes Kao :
You can find out more at weskao.com. I linked my course to my coaching from my main page. I also post on LinkedIn as well, so you can follow me there. And I'm always looking to meet fellow operators who out about communication. So if you put any of these principles into practice, I would love to hear about it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Awesome. We'll do that in the comments. They can DM you. I don't know, what's the best way to reach you on the website or Twitter?
Wes Kao :
Yeah, bunch of platforms.
Lenny Rachitsky :
All the places. Okay, cool.
Wes Kao :
Website, email, LinkedIn, DM me.
