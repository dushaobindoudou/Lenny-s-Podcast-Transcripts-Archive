**Second book is Andrew Roberts latest book on Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill is, really, one of my heroes. He was one of the most unusual, provocative statesmen/politicians of the 20th century. And here's another person that talked about tenacity, and ups and downs, and stick with it. And so, I do like to recommend that. Some people just tipped their head and said, "Ah, I don't know." It seems like maybe a boring book, but those are two books that I [inaudible 01**:

17:02].
Lenny Rachitsky :
Who would ever say that Churchill's story is boring? That's absurd.
David Placek :
I think so. I agree. I agree It's absurd, yes.
Lenny Rachitsky :
He's so fascinating. There's a recent documentary, I think, that really showed me the character. Incredible.
:
Okay. What's a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?
David Placek :
For me, it's the Yellowstone series. We're very fortunate as a family, we have some property in Montana. And-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh, wow. You're living the life.
David Placek :
Yeah, very... Listen, I can't tell you how fortunate I am. And I bought this property 28 years ago, so it was a lot cheaper then.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Wow.
David Placek :
In a snowstorm, and it just felt right. But I think particularly the 1883, the precursor to Yellowstone.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I was going to ask if you saw that because that was incredible.
David Placek :
Yes. And then the after one, 1923, which is the post-war. 1883 really gives people a sense of what it took by those early Americans to build a life in a place like... A beautiful place but a hard, tough place like Montana. And it's just phenomenal. The person producing and writing those things is incredibly talented. Taylor Sheridan, I think, is his name.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that in the story, Montana was the easy route almost from the journey they want on.
David Placek :
That's right. It's very, very true, yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Oh, man. Yeah, you almost don't even need to watch Yellowstone. Just starting with 1883 totally works.
David Placek :
Yeah. In fact, I recommend people. I say there's three. But if you really want the truth about the American West, it's 1883.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah. I suggested that on this podcast a bunch, actually. So, I love that. That's where you went.
:
Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love? Maybe one you named, maybe not.
David Placek :
I didn't name it, although it's got a very good name to it. Our whole family, I have two daughters and my wife, we're all fly fishermen, and last summer I really... I bought this for myself, but I gave it to my wife. It was one of those things that was present for her, but I knew I was going to use it more. And it's a Hardy. It's an old British fly rod, but it's a beautiful rod. It's just perfect for the big rivers of Montana. So, that's my favorite purchase.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's the first fly-fishing rod of the podcast. Excellent choice.
:
Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends or family?
David Placek :
I do. And it's a little longer, so I wrote it. I have it written here somewhere, but it's the quote from T.E. Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia, here. And if I can find it, I should be. I think it's a wonderful quote, so I think hopefully your viewers will like this. Here's what he said. He said that, "All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men for they may act on their dreams with open eyes to make them possible."
:
I read that years ago and it just hit me pretty hard, so yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That is an amazing quote. It makes me think about the quote about the man in the arena.
David Placek :
Yes. Yeah, it's same idea. It's just a little different. And I also think Lawrence of Arabia is a fascinating person, what he did. So, inspiring in some ways.
Lenny Rachitsky :
An amazing movie.
:
Okay, final question. Let me just try this. Is there a name that you didn't name that you're just like, "Wow, that was an amazing name. I wish I had come up with that name"?
David Placek :
I'll tell you there is one name, and it's DreamWorks. I think it's a wonderful name, and it's somewhat ironic that the entertainment industry in general has pretty mundane names. You have all of these talented people. And yet when you look at the names of production studios, movie houses, Comcast, things like that, it's very mundane. But here's DreamWorks, just like Sonos, check all the boxes. Compound dream. You expect something great from DreamWorks. They've created an experience, the experience of dreaming in a movie. I think it's a wonderful name. I wish I'd done it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's such a cool answer. David, thank you so much for doing this. This was incredible. I learned a ton as I imagined. I feel like a lot of people are going to have a much easier time thinking about approaching this topic.
David Placek :
Well, I certainly hope so. I do. It's been very, very enjoyable, very thoughtful, and I have nothing but or respect for the way you do this and the talent that you have. So, very fortunate that we've come together. And we live in the same place, so maybe we can get together for a cup of coffee or something.
Lenny Rachitsky :
We do. Northern California for the win. Thank you so much for being here.
David Placek :
You're very welcome.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Bye everyone.
David Placek :
Take care.
