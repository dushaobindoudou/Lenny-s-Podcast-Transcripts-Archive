## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### I think there's an assumption that bigger, more well-known agencies are going to do a better job. I think a lot of those bigger, well-known agencies are used to working with a lot of household brands. And so their strategies tend to be very reactive, focus in the messaging, maybe have to turn down a bunch of opportunities, control what people say. That is the polar opposite in my opinion of doing startup PR. Startup PR, you got to experiment, you got to try new things, you got to be scrappy, you got to be fast. We actually personally love diving into pitching right away rather than spending several months on messaging just testing and market right away. And so don't assume just because they have the huge logos... To your point, you're like, "Oh, well, you work with [inaudible 01

That's not necessarily a good thing, so don't just go buy the big logos. I would say that's my first piece of advice. My second piece of advice is find out what month one looks like with them.

**I think there's an assumption that bigger, more well-known agencies are going to do a better job. I think a lot of those bigger, well-known agencies are used to working with a lot of household brands. And so their strategies tend to be very reactive, focus in the messaging, maybe have to turn down a bunch of opportunities, control what people say. That is the polar opposite in my opinion of doing startup PR. Startup PR, you got to experiment, you got to try new things, you got to be scrappy, you got to be fast. We actually personally love diving into pitching right away rather than spending several months on messaging just testing and market right away. And so don't assume just because they have the huge logos... To your point, you're like, "Oh, well, you work with [inaudible 01**:

20:16] Perplexity, does that mean you know how to work with all these tiny companies?"
:
That's not necessarily a good thing, so don't just go buy the big logos. I would say that's my first piece of advice. My second piece of advice is find out what month one looks like with them. If month one is them just doing intake calls and learning about the company, and you're a startup that's still really paying close attention to how much money you're spending, you're not going to necessarily want to partner with an agency that needs a three-month ramp up cycle. And so really tactically understand what those first few months look like. I think that's something that I've noticed is a lot of agencies take a while before they get their hands dirty and start doing things. My third piece of advice would be writing recent writing samples. To the point of all those press release excerpts I shared, is that how they write? If it is, maybe they're not the right agency. So ask them. That's so easy. That's so easy to do.
:
Just ask them for a couple recent blogs or releases, whatever they tend to go for, and read those. And, of course, wins too. You want to see what kind of stories they're getting, but that's a little more obvious. A lot of people have already talked about this, so I'll just mention briefly, it's important to meet with the actual team you're working on, not just the founder of the agency. So asking who's our day-to-day going to be? Can we chat with them really quick? One thing I would say don't do is an extensive RFP process. We actually as an agency don't participate in RFPs. The two times I've done it, I have regretted it just because of the amount of work going in versus the value that's there. And it's you're asking a team to do a lot of free work for you, and generally I think the best players are not going to do that, so you're going to weed out some of the best players if you're asking them to do a lot of free upfront work. So those are a few considerations.
Lenny :
Perfect. And then just two more questions, because I imagine this is what people are thinking about when they're trying to decide should we find somebody is how long ahead of time they should find someone before something big is happening? And then just what's a budget they should have in mind for something like this? What's a minimum or a range, whatever you think would be helpful for people to understand here's how much you're probably going to be investing here?
Emilie Gerber :
Start times can vary from agency to agency. I think we can get started the week that a client needs us to, so maybe I'm not best equipped to answer this, but I would say before an announcement happens, you probably want to kick off six weeks in advance. So when we start with the company, it's like we're working on the blog, we're doing a media training, we're doing the media outreach, we're getting quotes from investors, or coordinating with all the parties, making sure images are being created so it's not just pitching and securing the article. So I would say buffer with time to pitch, make sure that the reporter is actually able to cover it. Six weeks is ideal. I would also note I highly recommend not having a firm date that you think you need to announce something and going instead with when a reporter is able to cover your story.
:
We get so many clients that come to us and they have this set date in their head, but there's not usually a real reason for it. It's like they're planning around it, it's like they have other comms they want to go out that day, but if you can optimize for the reporter over the timing, you're going to see such a better outcome because getting the first choice reporter is going to drive way more for your business than announcing it four days sooner. So leaving a little bit of flexibility for that agency is key. And I've even seen companies like issue a press release for big news with no coverage because they had stuck to a certain day and were very rigid about it, and they didn't get any stories for that reason. And so I think a good agency would counsel to offer that flexibility.
:
So six weeks I think is the ideal amount of time. And then budget, I would say the lowest end would probably be about 10K a month for an agency. You can find consultants, I think the best ones would be at least 8K a month, but for a small boutique agency starts at 10. I'll just be transparent, I'm very open about our pricing, our rates start at 15K a month for our retainers, and actually that's for a series A companies generally what they're at. And then I would say unless you are a global business that needs basically different teams for different product lines, which happens when you're a Microsoft of the world, that's another story. But if you're just a series C startup that's getting a lot of attention, I wouldn't go beyond 30K probably. There are plenty of agencies that go into the 50s and 60s a month, but that's just a whole nother world, and I'm not an expert on that part.
Lenny :
Amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. What if you're going for just a one-off, just help me get one story, what's a range there for budget you should expect?
Emilie Gerber :
I would say between 10 and 20. And you might be able to find a consultant that'll do it for eight.
Lenny :
Amazing. So helpful. Emilie, is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Emilie Gerber :
No. I'm ready.
Lenny :
Well, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions. Are you ready?
Emilie Gerber :
I am.
Lenny :
First question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?
Emilie Gerber :
I have one that's very top of mind right now, so it's How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan. Actually, I leave tonight for a week long psilocybin retreat.
Lenny :

Emilie Gerber :
I know. I would be getting much more philosophical maybe.
Lenny :
Wow.
Emilie Gerber :
So very excited, I'm going to Jamaica.
Lenny :
Amazing.
Emilie Gerber :
And ever since researching that field, there's the whole concept of changing your neural pathways is just very fascinating to me. And just opening up and shifting perspectives is something that I think will actually help me a lot just even in running a company, being a better leader, I think we're at a stage in our growth right now where we're hiring a lot and there's a lot of pressure and I just want to make sure I'm bringing my best self forward every day. And so I'm really excited about it.
Lenny :
What an amazing answer. This is going to be part of your set and setting this interview, but hopefully you can get it out of your mind.
Emilie Gerber :
No, totally. I was nervous. I'm like, "It's actually really great that this is happening and then I can completely unplug after it. And so I think it's actually good timing.
Lenny :
I'm excited to hear how it goes.
Emilie Gerber :
I'm not a big book recommender. I have ADHD and reading full books is very hard for me, and so I'm just going to leave you with that one. I can do the occasional beach read I'll really focus, but it's not my main format of content consumption.
Lenny :
Amazing. All right, great answer. One's plenty. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?
Emilie Gerber :
My favorite genre is post-apocalyptic, end of the world survival. I need to mention my all time favorite show, because it would be bad not to. So Walking Dead is my comfort TV show, I can watch it when I'm going to sleep at night, but my most recent favorite was Yellowjackets. Are you familiar?
Lenny :
I've seen the poster on my TV, but I've not watched it.
Emilie Gerber :
Nice. I discovered it a little late. I think the second season finished and they're working on the third. But it has plane crash, and it has just shocking moment after shocking moment like cannibalism, very weird stuff. And it's one of those shows that sticks in your mind, which I like where you're thinking about it afterwards. It's kind of creepy.
Lenny :
Wow. I thought you were going for Last of Us, but I now have to watch this show.
Emilie Gerber :
No, I watched Last of Us and I didn't feel like it had enough survival elements to it. It was like storytelling in that environment, but it wasn't actually a survival post-apocalyptic show in the way that I was looking for.
Lenny :
Hardcore. Do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask? And you could take this in any direction you want.
Emilie Gerber :
Yeah. I have a new one. We actually just revamped our interview process, so I wanted to make it harder. So my new favorite question is if a client comes to you and they're convinced they have something that's press worthy, like an announcement that they think should be, I don't know, in the Wall Street Journal or something, and you know for a fact that it isn't, what steps do you take? What do you do next? And I like that question because they can handle it, one, from the client relations standpoint, how do you communicate with the client when they say something like that, but it's also a critical thinking and creativity question of how do you take a no and turn it into a yes? How do you take what they're giving you and make it into something interesting? And so I like to dig into that, and they can use a real example if they want, but I also think a lot of our job is pushing back in a way. And so that also shows if they're able and willing to push back.
Lenny :
I'm so curious to hear people's answer to that. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you love?
Emilie Gerber :
I was very skeptical of Apple Vision Pro and I was making fun of it at the beginning, and the first time I tried it, I completely changed my tune, I'm so into it, I'm ordering one, and I'm very excited for actually using it for work. I think it could be a really good use case for just my day-to-day at work. After I had tried it, the next day I messaged a bunch of clients that I thought could have relevant applications for it. I'm like, "Do we have an Apple Vision Pro strategy? Are we billing to talk about it publicly yet?" Because sometimes it's tying back to the PR conversation, I love if you're willing to push the envelope on stuff that you are building or are going to do and getting ahead of those conversations, so that's a lot of conversations I'm having right now is trying to convince clients to talk about that.
Lenny :
So you have an Apple Vision Pro strategy, amazing.
Emilie Gerber :
And then my other one, which is very self-serving, because they are a client, but I do use them every day, is Perplexity. I find it so helpful even just for like I'm working on an award submission, I forgot how much funding a client has raised, asking them that instead of opening five different Google links and trying to find the answer, it's just huge for quick information. Or writing a bio for an executive, getting just the TLDR of what they've done in their past, it's so good for PR use cases, and I actually think marketing and PR is going to be one of the core work applications for them.
Lenny :
I've also already shared how much I love Perplexity, I have the Chrome extension installed. I probably use it at least once a day for podcast interview prep along with a bunch of other stuff. So good find for customer. I think they're going to do great. Wish I was an investor.
Emilie Gerber :
I'm the happy investor. I rarely angel invest and I was...
Lenny :
Drinks on Emilie someday.
Emilie Gerber :
There we go.
Lenny :
That's awesome. Good job.
Emilie Gerber :
Thank you.
Lenny :
Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, either in work or in life?
Emilie Gerber :

**Strong opinions loosely held, I'm a very opinionated trust my gut kind of person, but that doesn't mean I'm not willing to change my mind on things and be wrong. I first heard it from an influencer [inaudible 01**:

31:38] and then I Googled it, and apparently... What was it? Jeff Bezos also said it at one point, so I have no idea the origin of the quote, but I think that's a good one. You can still be really opinionated in life, but that doesn't mean you always are going to be right.
Lenny :
Emilie, this was everything I hoped it would be. I feel like this is going to help so many people get awesome press. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you and reach out if they want to learn more or work with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Emilie Gerber :
Our website is sixeastern.com and our email is hello@sixeastern.com, so you can find us there. And actually I have a newsletter called On Background. It's on Substack. And really what it's intended to be is a place for people to find these tactical opportunities, so it has media moves, it has reporters that are working on stories, it has awards that are open, all of this stuff that basically an intern in an agency would spend their days researching we put into a newsletter. And so its main audience is PR people, but I actually think it could be a great resource for people within companies that don't have PR teams to stay on top of stuff. So I guess to be helpful, feel free to subscribe. And then other than that, we're hiring, so if you happen to be a PR person that got this far in the episode, always looking for great people to bring on.
Lenny :
Amazing. Is there anything specific you're looking for in people you're hiring for people that may want to reach out other than they've been in PR?
Emilie Gerber :
Ideally some B2B experience. I think doing B2B PR is very different from doing consumer PR. If you work with startups, that's a huge plus, you know how to be kind of scrappy and fast. And also people that just love to be really hands-on and doing the actual work. We're very flat, so we're not a place where there's much managing of teams. So it's really much more like a consultancy than anything else.
Lenny :
Amazing. Emilie, thank you so much for being here.
Emilie Gerber :
Yeah, it was so fun. Thank you so much.
Lenny :
