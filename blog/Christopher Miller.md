Chris Miller :
The deal pipeline, the real old school way, and that was sort of their locus of control for their sales team. Right?

And so there are use cases like that if you're a smaller team, you kind of have an acute understanding of the pain points that are like today's buyers that you need to put out. You don't have to deal with the burden of a huge data migration. And the person who's going to be in the CRM day in and day out is also the person who gets to make the final call on...

### And I think the key thing is that humans can be a backstop. There are moments where it's going to make sense for humans to be a backstop. One example that is I think is really normal, a hardship circumstance where a customer needs to end their relationship, right? Like every SaaS company deals with this. Some take a fully automated approach, but most usually have some sort of escalation path that will result in a human having to resolve this. It doesn't make them any less product led. I think every company at its core is having some humans behind the scenes interface with customers on things related to go-to-market. But I think once defining that and getting on the same page about that, I think you can learn a lot. And by the way, these are the normal conversations that I have with founders all the time. I'm actually an operator in residence at OpenView, and so I speak to a lot of their poor [inaudible 01

And I think what's always interesting is how different the sort of array of answers are when you ask that question. Some are like, oh, it's about top of the funnel demand. We want to be more product led because we want more leads, we want more signups. You're like, "Oh, okay." And that's a very defensible reason. There's a lot of data that shows that freemium products attract a lot more top of the funnel demand than sales led ...

Is there anything really fun about the culture, like a fun thing that you all do that's a quirky HubSpot ritual?
Chris Miller :
Yeah, there's a ton, but I think there's definitely a very legitimate school of thought around how culture can both contribute to inclusion, but also, be a headwind to inclusion. I think a lot of the things that I might associate with HubSpot culture are very much rooted in a specific period of HubSpot, right? It was probably a pre-pandemic period. It was probably a period where we were all working in the same physical space. And so, there's a lot of inside jokes. And sometimes the things are rooted in very specific quirks of specific individuals who may not even be at the company anymore. And so, if you're someone who's joined the company in the past two or three years and that flies over your head-
Chris Miller :
The company in the past two or three years, and that flies over your head. I think we have to ask ourselves, "What's the value of continuing to embrace these things?" And so I think what we've been doing over the years is taking inventory of the things that might have been considered part of HubSpot legacy culture and really trying to again, pressure test it. Does this continue to serve us today? And if not, we should be really comfortable of letting it go.
:
But one of the things that I think is super dope that we do is we do this thing called PEER Week, which was something that popped up during the pandemic and the TLDR is that it's like an event for product and engineering; where travel changed with the pandemic and people don't get to see each other in person as much, but there's a couple of weeks in the summer in June where we fly everybody in either if you're in North America, we fly you to Cambridge. If you were in Europe somewhere, then we fly you to Dublin and we spend a week together.
:
There's not a ton of focus on just classic productivity. There's a ton of focus on building connections and safety and just getting to know people and who they are as human beings, but also, damn I forgot how much I missed whiteboarding. It's actually being able to get in a room with a physical whiteboard of people and work on some stuff. And so this is, I think the second year in a row, or second or third I don't remember, pandemic years have really fogged the brain... That we've done it. And it's one of the things I look most forward to every year is getting everybody in the same city to just hang out.
Lenny :
I love it. I keep peeking at these highlights and they're really interesting. So we're going to link to this culture code also in the show notes if you want to check it out. But anyway, let's focus on how HubSpot grows. And there's kind of two parts, in my mind there's just like, how did it start and what worked really well. You're actually on the inaugural team, I believe, of HubSpot's growth team and things worked out. Well done. I'm curious maybe just to start what you think you did so right, early on in the history of HubSpot to help it grow into the behemoth it has become. What was kind of the early success elements that were key?
Chris Miller :
I would say the early years of doing freemium. And for the record, there's definitely an iteration of the growth team before I joined that, you know really like Brian Balfour was the person who I would say injected that first dose of PLG DNA into HubSpot. So shout out to Brian. I want to make sure he gets the credit that he's owed.
Lenny :
Yeah, we're going to have him on the podcast at some point. It's in the works.
Chris Miller :
Yeah, he's a legend. Brian's great.
Lenny :
Absolute legend.
Chris Miller :
And so after Brian had left HubSpot, it was a bit start and stop. And so when I joined and we sort of took another stab at it, I think there were a few things we did. One, in the beginning is we really had an aggressive mentality, an aggressive approach I think. And by we, I mean the team, the actual really small initial growth team. We tried not to be pedantic about where we were spending our time. And so we sort of tossed our mission and charter out of the window. We said, cool, maybe on paper we were, I think the sales tool, activation team. It was a very boutique mission and remit compared to I think a lot of the other teams at HubSpot's missions and remit at the time.
:
But even though that's what we were supposed to be working on paper, we were sort of like, if we find something that looks like an opportunity and no one else in the business is thinking about it, we're just going to try to fix it. We're going to ask for forgiveness rather than permission and start to call some plays.
:
And what that looked like was at the time, a very small percentage of, I think HubSpot's subscription revenue would be described as self-service, like people putting in their credit card and buying something. It was predominantly product driven leads like PQLs. And so we were literally sending everything to the sales team, which it was running revenue, but certainly opportunities for efficiency because it was the first time we'd really had a product at a price point that could be transactional and not a highly considered purchase. And so we were thinking about this and we were like, "Well, how does this work? Is there even a pricing page in the product that people could actually buy something?"And we found it, but it had been neglected. It was sort of like, I think no one was sort of committing any code to that repository.
:
So we approached a team who owned it and we were like, "Are y'all working on this? Is this an active development?" And they were like, "Nah, we're working on a bunch of other stuff." We were like, "Can we take this?" And they were like, "Sure, if you want it, take it. It's one less code base for us to maintain." And so we took it and immediately blew it up. We redesigned the whole thing focused on discoverability, how are people getting to this page, focusing on desirability, like how are we talking about the value props of the things that we're wanting to sell to customers to help them grow better. And then thinking about doability or usability, how do we actually just remove the friction that's standing in the way?
:
And so we did a mad dash towards this outcome we wanted to drive, and when we released it worked. It was actually a step function change in the way that the physics of the business and the funnel really looked. And I think that was probably a catalyst moment of everyone saying, "Oh wow, there might actually be something here." And so that attitude of saying that every problem is our problem and being willing to really take a mentality of like, I think radical accountability and ownership mentality helped us find opportunities that maybe the business wasn't explicitly asking us to solve, but we were able to triangulate why it might be important for the business for us to solve it.
:
And when you do that, I think the business, a business may get more comfortable putting more on your plate. Right? And so it's like we look hungry, so let's keep feeding us. And so over time our remit expands and there's other things that we think are opportunities to gain leverage for the business or deliver a delight to our customers in a more efficient way, and honestly in a way that they probably expected to engage with us at that point in time. It was quite odd that there were so many humans involved in every stage of the customer journey and some of our customers just like, "I just want to be able to try the thing and buy it if I want to be. I really don't want to be forced into a sales engagement." And so it was really kind of meeting the expectations of the modern software buyer in many ways.
Lenny :
It sounds incredibly important. Basically your team turned HubSpot into a very product led growth business, which feels very important in the history of HubSpot's growth. Would you consider what was there before where it was the beginnings of self-service, but they had to talk to a salesperson? Would you consider that product led?
Chris Miller :
Yes.
Lenny :
Okay.
Chris Miller :
Yes.
Lenny :
And so how would you describe what the shift was in terms of the way the sales motion and growth motion changed?
Chris Miller :
The go-to-market motions that we were working on definitely fit under, I think the broad umbrella of PLG, but I don't think the culture of the company was necessarily explicit about being a PLG company. I don't think that's the way we talked about who HubSpot was and trust me, there were a bunch of other factors in here. I definitely, I won't say that our team were the sole driving force behind that shift in our strategy and approach, but certainly the data that we were able to collect and the experiments we were able to run and the insights we were able to surface and the research we were able to synthesize... It gave us conviction to double down on it for sure. And that was definitely maybe the beginning of that inflection point for the company, but there was certainly a lot of other things that led to us wanting to become more product led.
:
Again, I think about it, I think any company is probably searching for ways to operate more efficiently. And if your revenue is so tied to go-to-market headcount, it gets really hard to scale the bigger you get. And so I think there's an innate desire to want to be more non-linear in our growth. And I think us arriving at the right place at the right time created sort of alignment around what the path forward could look like. If we want to live in that world, how might we get there? And I think that's where we really fit into the equation. It's like, "Oh, we invest in this team. If we invest in the type of work this team is doing, that's how we're going to build efficiencies over time." And it's also, we like that because it's in line with what our customers are already expecting from us.
Lenny :
And it sounds like you weren't like, "We need to be more product led." It was more just how do we get the sales process more efficient and the motion of growth more efficient and that emerged out of that.
Chris Miller :
Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong. We were definitely like, we need to be more product led. And I think that's actually the nuance here. You asked would I consider what we were doing product led growth? And I think the answer is absolutely, but that's because a fallacy that people, a lot of, I think maybe early stage founders or folks who are unfamiliar with chronic growth or maybe only know about it from an academic point of view, maybe fall into the trap of is assuming that in order to be a PLG company you can use that interchangeably with being a fully self-service business or fully self-service go-to market.
:
I don't actually think that those things are one and the same. I think that most companies, at least the larger, more successful ones that have done amazing things and are cornering their market or category, that we would consider to be PLG companies have a bunch of humans working on really important things on their go to market, and it's more of a hybrid motion. And I think it's less about, again, being sort of myopic about your approach to PLG and having it being really rooted in principles that are, I think very kind of academic or conceptual in nature.
:
But more sort of being pragmatic and saying, "Okay, cool. Who is our customer? What is the product that we sell? How are our customers used to buying this thing? How would they prefer to buy it in the future that they would like to live in? What's the packaging of our products? How do our customers decide? Is it a top down decision or a bottoms up decision? How complex are our building and subscription terms is something that's going to be pretty transactional or something that's going to be fairly considered? How comfortable is our target market with the technology in our category? Are we competing against non-consumption? Are we competing against competitors in the same category?"
:
And if you actually answer those questions, and I think it may be obvious where I'm going with this, but based on the answer to those questions, the conditions on the ground might lend themselves to be more favorable to product-led growth and be more favorable to self-service, right? It's why there are companies that the value prop is just so... Like you don't need a person to sell you Loom. I use Loom and it's so intuitive that I can just decide on my own whether I want to buy it. You don't need a person to teach you how to use even Slack to some example. Like Slack is extremely intuitive. Right? Like you could throw someone in Slack and use a product in a similar paradigm and it can probably figure out the basics on their own.
:
There are certain products that don't necessarily check those boxes. And so I think what you can do is kind of take a more modular approach to PLG, and it's like based on how a customer in the best case scenario might go from zero to one when it comes to activation and onboarding, do we need to have a human involved in that process at all? Or as a backstop? If the answer is yes, then maybe figure out ways to have humans involved where your cost structure is durable or at least defensible. If that's not the case, then go take a PLG approach to it.
:
And so across our entire business, we've never taken a very pure, everything here for this line of business or this product line is going to be self-service without being able to defend and contextualize why across the entire customer journey this makes sense. And so yeah, we have customers who come in through the product led front door and kick the tires on the product on their own and activate on the product on their own. But then when it comes time to buy the product, they want to talk to somebody and there's legitimate reasons why, right? There are maybe IT and security concerns that they need to get somebody on the phone for. Maybe they're coming for a platform where data migration is a huge fear they have, and that's not something that's easy to do in a self-service environment yet. I think that's going to change over time. But today it's still kind of painful when you're doing rip and replaces.
:
And so to try to brute force that into a sort of self-service motion for every customer writ large would be solving for your business' desires, not necessarily solving for the customer at the end of the day. But we also sell into different segments of customers that are maybe digital natives but not familiar with products in our category. And maybe they're coming from not a competing product, but they're coming from a more rudimentary system like spreadsheets. I mean, I've seen customers using post-it notes to manage their.
Lenny :

**[inaudible 00**:

59:25].
Chris Miller :
The deal pipeline, the real old school way, and that was sort of their locus of control for their sales team. Right?
:
And so there are use cases like that if you're a smaller team, you kind of have an acute understanding of the pain points that are like today's buyers that you need to put out. You don't have to deal with the burden of a huge data migration. And the person who's going to be in the CRM day in and day out is also the person who gets to make the final call on what CRM they're going to use. There's a ton of those customers that we never talk to in person, right? And that's awesome too. And so being comfortable with things not necessarily fitting into clean boxes and having conviction that a modular approach or a more hybrid approach is actually the way to optimize for the customer and the business at the end of the day is something that I think we embraced really early on.
:
One of the first metrics that I had was activation rate, but it was also how much demand am I sending to the sales team? And there was no turf war about that, right? It's like, oh, that's net positive for if people are able to get helped and a lot of the questions that they have cannot be answered with the product today, we should absolutely be proud to connect them with one of our awesome people in sales who can be like, help see if the solutions we offer are a good fit for them. And there are instances where people just don't want to talk to somebody, and our job is to make sure that there's a friction-free way for them to make that decision on their own.
Lenny :
Amazing. I think on the one hand, this could be a whole podcast is just talking about your PLG learnings, knowing... It feels like HubSpot is one of the biggest success stories of transitioning more and more into PLG, at least at that point. Even though you're saying it was PLG early on, it feels like a huge shift to the business. So I really like this framework you just shared of if you're trying to become more product led, just think about the zero to one from visit to activation and when does someone really have to talk to someone and how do we help them not have to talk to people in that moment? So either in that direction or just broadly, if someone was trying to explore how do we become more product led, what are the first couple steps and dives you would recommend they do to help them down that road?
Chris Miller :
First I would ask, why do you want to be product led? What assumptions are you making in terms of why being product led are going to be net positive for the business or for your customers? And I might even ask them to define what product-led means to them that we can get on the same page of what we're even talking about.
Lenny :
How would you define it? Do you have a rough, an answer to that? Just so people get a sense of what it probably means.
Chris Miller :
Yeah. At the highest level, it's like taking a go-to-market approach where your product job is to grow revenue and you use humans as a backstop and not the other way around.
Lenny :
Awesome.
Chris Miller :

**And I think the key thing is that humans can be a backstop. There are moments where it's going to make sense for humans to be a backstop. One example that is I think is really normal, a hardship circumstance where a customer needs to end their relationship, right? Like every SaaS company deals with this. Some take a fully automated approach, but most usually have some sort of escalation path that will result in a human having to resolve this. It doesn't make them any less product led. I think every company at its core is having some humans behind the scenes interface with customers on things related to go-to-market. But I think once defining that and getting on the same page about that, I think you can learn a lot. And by the way, these are the normal conversations that I have with founders all the time. I'm actually an operator in residence at OpenView, and so I speak to a lot of their poor [inaudible 01**:

03:01], and this is usually the conversation that we end up having.
:
And I think what's always interesting is how different the sort of array of answers are when you ask that question. Some are like, oh, it's about top of the funnel demand. We want to be more product led because we want more leads, we want more signups. You're like, "Oh, okay." And that's a very defensible reason. There's a lot of data that shows that freemium products attract a lot more top of the funnel demand than sales led go-to-market products do. Right? Some, it might be a matter of constrained resources. We absolutely need to be more product led in the stage of the company because we simply cannot hire an army of implementation specialists and folks on the customer success outside of the house to help every single customer at scale, which is generally a byproduct of having a really large top of the funnel. And then there are others that are, it's about revenue efficiency.
:
And so when you can kind of articulate the outcomes that you want to drive, it helps triangulate where to begin. So if you are really focused on top of the funnel demand, trying to do self-service checkout is a silly place to start. And so just really doing the fun exercise of articulating why do you care about this? Why are you actually interested in this in the first place? If you do this, what would change about your business? What assumptions are you making? And when you can actually list those things out, you can map them to parts of the customer journey where there may be opportunity to be more product led if the company isn't there yet.
Lenny :
Awesome. Maybe a couple more questions along these lines and then I just have a couple more questions I definitely want to ask. When someone is trying to go in the direction of product led growth, A.K.A. more self-service, and I guess maybe let me just ask, is that sort of how you think about the equivalency of those two?
Chris Miller :
Sure.
Lenny :
Okay. What are maybe the most common mistakes they make that aren't as obvious?
Chris Miller :
I mean, the number one mistake is hiring a head of growth, giving them no resources and expecting them to pull rabbit out of their hat.
:
I feel like every PLG veteran has some joke that they tell about the poor head of growth who has no tooling, no engineering cycles, no designer, no access to data, and then are handed a really scary big number and told to go move it. I think that's a common mistake that has stood the test of time.
:
Another one is expecting really quick turnaround and thinking of it the same way you might think about hiring a sales, an incremental sales headcount, which is that you're expecting near term liquidity from that investment, but when you're doing PLG at its core, it's still R&D. You're still sort of planting seeds with the hope that over time this is going to play out in the form of durable pie efficient growth. But if you're expecting, you put a team on something and then you want that team to sort of have outsize impact, and sure there's going to be low hanging fruit, but I think just not having the patience to see the investment through and cutting bait too early is another, I think mistake some companies make.
:
And then I also think that bad data hygiene is the other one. So not having taken a beat to properly instrument their product, messy data, no real self-service way for people to access that data. Like having analyst bottlenecks can be a terrible position to be in. And so eating your veggies, getting your house in order from a data standpoint, I think is a crucial first step because if you can't actually measure what's happening, then like why?
:
And then maybe the last one is people giving up because they don't have enough data, right? They're like, we can't do PLG because we don't have this massive data set the way that HubSpot has or the way the Airbnb has. And it's like you can still do PLG, you just need to use different data. The way we think about data is that quant data is just another form of data. The same way experiment results are just another data point. You can learn a ton from just talking to customers. Like qual research is super-duper important, and so if you don't have data to tell you exactly what every single person is doing in your product in aggregate, you can still talk to 10 customers and probably get a clear sense of what's happening and why it's happening. That you wouldn't even get from the quant data.
:
So people getting demotivated or companies getting demotivated because they think they're too early to do PLG, you can still do PLG. PLG at its core is just having your product sell the value prop of what your business does, and you can still deliver on that without being able to stand up a very robust and sophisticated experimentation practice.
Lenny :
Kind of along those lines, but going even broader. Without disclosing trade secrets of how HubSpot works, how would you describe the loop of growth of HubSpot? In the words of, you mentioned Brian Belfor and Fareed, what is the growth loop of HubSpot either now or recently? Just a simple way to think about how HubSpot grows.
Chris Miller :

**Our loops are less tactical. In fact, if I'm being brutally honest, I think loops are kind of hard to achieve in B2B SaaS. I think there's some examples of that, but I think some of the best loops come from UGC, user generated content. I think a lot of B2C community focused platforms can do loops really well. I think if it's B2B SaaS, it's hard to find things that get loopy. And it is me going, I think all my Reforge [inaudible 01**:

08:40] are going to be upset that I said that. But I think that's the truth.
:
When I think about the flywheel of HubSpot, I think it's more of a macro flywheel. And just to kind of lean into our own lingo, it's really attracting gage and delight. And so, one of the principles that guides our thinking and our strategy is give value before you extract value. And I think that was at the core...
Chris Miller :
Give value before you extract value, and I think that was at the core of inbound marketing at its inception, that outbound marketing was asking for something from customers or prospects before giving anything. And so at its core it's like, okay, yeah, if you give a little for free, people who are interested in sort of hearing the rest of how that album sounds are going to come and stick around for more. And so in our pre PLG days, it was content marketing and white papers and listicles and eBooks and things that people had to download that were really filling the top of the funnel. And that is just taking another form with PLG.
:
And so we intentionally put out a lot of free software. And the idea is that this software is not sort of gimmicky. It's not designed to run out of value on day one. It's actually designed so that our smallest customers can get some value out of it in a sustainable way. But if they're engaging with it deeply enough, they're going to run into the limits of what that value is. And if we've done our jobs and delivered what we believe we were supposed to deliver, then the decision to purchase becomes a no-brainer.
:
And if they're delighted with the experience of being a customer, they're going to become advocates, and they're going to become promoters, and they're going to tell their peers. Because what we also know is that a lot of small business owners and even medium-sized business owners take a lot of guidance from their community of peers. And sometimes that's a digital community, sometimes that's not. And so anytime we win an advocate through delivering an excellent customer experience, they bring more people into the top of the funnel. And so it's a really honest, and I would say an honest macro loop in the sense, but that's the way we think about our flywheel.
Lenny :
Oh man, this could be a whole other hour of a podcast just diving into this stuff. This is so good. You shared this interesting story that I wasn't aware of. So HubSpot's kind of known for content and SEO. You search for anything and there's always a HubSpot article about it. And so is what you're sharing here, essentially that was a big part of the early days, SEO, free content that drove people to the site and the product wasn't free, is what I'm hearing. And then it shifted to now it's a free product that anyone can use and that's what drives the top of funnel.
Chris Miller :
Yes, correct.
Lenny :
Amazing.
Chris Miller :
I can't give a specific number, but a large percentage of our revenue flows through the product. And it's not necessarily maybe where people ultimately purchased, but that's their sort of first conversion event with us. They were in the product, they liked what they saw, they spoke to somebody, and then eventually became a customer. And that is now a pretty robust top of the funnel for the company.
Lenny :
So I think this is a really interesting story of just starting with one growth channel of SEO essentially, content marketing and then shifting to something else. Is there any lessons from that experience for people trying to kickstart their growth of SEO versus this freemium approach? Is there anything there that just like this worked really well for us and you should probably try this, or SEO kind of runs out in this specific type of business?
Chris Miller :
I'll admit I'm definitely not an SEO expert. I've been fortunate to work with some of the best marketers in the world who I think are bonafide legends at this point in terms of what they've been able to achieve at HubSpot and building that lead and signup machine.
:
What I will say is being really aggressive about experimenting with new channels is so important, and diversifying your channel mix is so important because things can change overnight and that might disrupt your entire funnel. Like a Google algorithm change can have a massive impact. If you're reliant on app store optimization, a change in Apple's algorithm might have a massive impact. What we're seeing with generative AI, I think there's a lot of people losing sleep at night because it's unclear how this is going to impact SEO writ large. If that's what fuels your entire business is being on Google search result page, then what's going to happen in this new sort of world we're about to enter?
:
And so I think to the extent that you can not have your funnel be relying on a single or a couple of channels is really important. We're always testing new channels. One of the channels that we're spending some time experimenting with is this concept of microapps. And it's actually not a new concept for HubSpot. One of the first microapps you ever built was a... Maybe Dharmesh built this, the original one, but it was called Website Grader. And it was you put in your domain, and it crawled your site, and then gave you a set of recommendations for how you would optimize your site. And it was free. It was definitely a one trick pony. But what it did was it created an interesting conversation, which is like, okay, cool, now that you have this information, what are you going to do about it? And one of the things you could do is you could become a HubSpot customer and you can use our product to fix a lot of this stuff.
:
And that worked for us. It worked really, really well. And so we've done that play a few times and it's something that we'll probably continue to do. We have a bunch of these microapps. We have a brand kit generator, we have an email signature generator. We've experimented with a Build My Persona generator. There's a couple of ones that I can't talk about right now, but we'll learn a little bit about in a few weeks at Inbound. But yeah, microapps are an exciting new channel for us. And some will be successes, some will flop, and we'll probably sunset them. But being willing to fail in the pursuit of finding new distribution channels is also really important.
Lenny :
That's an awesome insight. Is there a place people can go to find these microapps that you all have built?
Chris Miller :
There will be soon.
Lenny :
Oh, mysterious. I also noticed Dharmesh tweeting about some AI projects he's working on. Is that related to these microapps? Or is that just him on his own time just doing fun stuff?
Chris Miller :
Very related to microapps. I would say ChatSpot is actually, and for those who don't know what ChatSpot is, ChatSpot is a bit of an AI copilot that Dharmesh built that has sort of been very positively received by both HubSpot customers and non-HubSpot customers alike. And so that's something that we're, wearing my AI hat, spending a lot of time thinking about, sort of what direction do we want to go in the ChatSpot.
:
But again, it was something that we put out in the universe to see what happens. And now it's like, oh, we're getting an interesting amount of signups every month. Who would've guessed that? I don't think that... That definitely wasn't on the roadmap a year ago. And I think being a 17-year-old SaaS company that can still operate with that sense of urgency and pace helps a lot to why wait to get consensus on a decision when we can put something out there and then see what happens and see what the data says.
Lenny :
Yeah, I was just going to say that it feels like it's such a win-win-win, including it's just a release for people on the team that have been there for a long time just to work on something totally different and new and just launch a new product.
Chris Miller :
Yeah, 100%.
Lenny :
I love that. Is there anything that just significantly accelerated growth in the last, I don't know, number of years that was like, wow, this really changed the game.
Chris Miller :
Covid. Covid was obviously challenging and awful on so many levels, but it was scary. It was super scary. We were all terrified. We didn't know what it meant for our jobs. My own sister, who also works at HubSpot now, she at the time was transitioning into hospitality and was two months into her job when she got furloughed because of Covid. So who knew what the world was going to look like and how it was going to impact businesses?
:
I think we were prepared for the worst, and we actually caught a bit of the Covid tailwind and a lot of other businesses did, because companies who never had to think about digital marketing all of a sudden had to, and it was urgent. It was a burning need for them to figure out how they were going to weather the storm. And I think one of the things that HubSpot did, and this is one of the sort of phrases we use internally, is never waste a good crisis.
:
And so, one of the things we leaned into was sort of goodwill pricing, and we lowered the price on some of our tools and created some temporary leniency around certain things. And just the removal of that friction ended up being a really interesting tailwind for the business and specifically for the business that I run, which is our starter business, our free and starter business, we really accelerated growth during that period, which was not... I think if you would've looked at my Bingo card in March of 2020, I don't know that I had that on the Bingo card.
Lenny :
I'm looking at the stock price in another window here and I could see what happened. That went great, and even it came down with the whole market, but it's coming right back up. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
Chris Miller :
Yeah.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Chris Miller :
Truthfully, I don't read a ton of books. Got a one and a half year old. I also probably didn't read a ton of books before, but it's a nice excuse to have. That's why I don't have time to read today. But when I think of books that I think about a lot still, there's a book called Everybody Lies, and it's a book... I believe the guy who wrote it was a data scientist at Google. And part of the message is that everybody's a data scientist and really trying to democratize the idea of using data in your everyday lives to make decisions and demystifying the idea of data science. But the way he kind of does this is through comparing Google search data and what we know people to be actively looking for answers for, with sort of qualitative survey data. And people lie on surveys all the time for a variety of different reasons, but no one lies to Google because it's transactional. If I lie to Google, I'm not going to get what I want. And so it kind of really explores what it means to tell the truth and how honest we are with ourselves and with the internet. And so I really love that book.
:
The other book I really love is Chop Wood Carry Water, which it's like a parable about a young boy who wants to become a samurai. But the sort of message of the book is about falling in love with the process, especially the most mundane parts of a process of becoming great at something. And that's something I... It's a good reminder about patience, humility, and sort of taking things one step at a time. And I often reference Chop Wood Carry Water a lot.
Lenny :
Reminds me of The Score Takes Care of Itself, I think is the name of the book.
Chris Miller :
Yeah, yeah, I've heard of it.
Lenny :
Bill Walsh. Amazing. Okay. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?
Chris Miller :
Oh, man. On Amazon Prime, I'm a Virgo, and it's a Boots Riley show. Boots Riley directed Sorry to Bother You. It just blew my mind. It's super surreal and funny and dark and it stars Jharrel Jerome, who I think he played one of the characters in the Netflix Central Park Five. I think he won a couple of awards for that too. And that was a show I watched recently where I had no expectations going into it other than I knew it was a Boots Riley show and was just enthralled. It touches on... It is a really cheeky way of touching on a lot of really important topics, but often hard to talk about topics and themes, and it's kind of delightful to get through it. So, I'm a Virgo. I just binged Barry from season one through four. Henry Winkler was spectacular. And then just came off of Succession, too. The theme here is I really dark comedies. Yeah, really, really dark comedies are kind of my thing.
Lenny :
And that first one was called I Am a Virgo, because I thought you were just saying you're a Virgo.
Chris Miller :
No, no. The name of the show is called I'm a Virgo. Yeah.
Lenny :
Amazing. I will check that out. Okay. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?
Chris Miller :
I think it depends on what level of role that they're interviewing for. I don't really interview as many frontline PMs anymore, but I used to really like doing case study questions and really random ones too. I'd be like, "Tell me how many people crossed the Longfellow Bridge in a week." And I could not care less what the actual number they arrived at was, but it's more for me to observe what's the array of data points that they can kind of start to collect in their mind to inform their calculus, and how close can they get to ballpark, and what's their defense behind their thinking. And then just the process of watching people's brains move in those moments is... You learn a lot about how they might operate as a product manager I think in those scenarios. I try not to overdo them, because I do think there's a lot of inherent bias in some of those types of questions. And so trying to think of things that are really relatable to anybody who might be looking to work on a team that I'm leading is I think a requirement there.
:
But I would say the other question I really like to ask is, if the people that you most recently worked with were in a room and you weren't there, how would they talk about you? One, it's because sometimes I will reach out and get references, and so the extent to which that might actually be part of the interview process is very legitimate, but also I think it is usually very clear whether the person is taking an honest and introspective and self-aware approach to answering that question. And I like to see people being really self-aware, because I don't think anybody ever comes in any situation perfect. I have a lot of rough edges to my personality that I think people have just learned to deal with over the years, but I try to be self-aware about them at the... If I can do nothing else, if I can't change them, at least recognize them and do what I can to mitigate the blast radius.
:
And so I think just getting a sense of the EQ of a candidate and their self-awareness is really important for me because at the end of the day, if you're in product, you can be the smartest person in the room, but if people don't want to work with you, you're probably not going to go very far.
Lenny :
Do you have a favorite life motto that you come back to or you share with other people?
Chris Miller :
The details matter.
Lenny :
And that's both in work and life, I imagine?
Chris Miller :
Yeah, the details matter. The details matter. I read a cool interview with the product leadership team at Stripe, and one of the things they talk about is for their product managers, they want you to have taste. And it was a really kind of controversial thing to say because it was like, "Oh, that is so subjective. Who gets to decide what taste is?" Maybe that's even biased to some extent.
:
And I think they had a super defensible answer about how they define taste, and taste in their opinion was to be so interested in something, it doesn't matter what that thing is, where you can go deep enough in it to have a strong set of informed opinions. And that's how they defined it. And they were almost ambivalent to what that thing that was, what the subject was. But having taste, having something that you were passionate about, that you have spent enough time learning and understanding and appreciating and critiquing and being frustrated with that you have a point of view that is potentially even polarizing is taste. Riding the fence is usually not taste. And so when I think about the details matter, that's almost like a nod to taste. Obsess over the details of something, whether that be art, music, product, film, whatever. I care a lot about that.
Lenny :
I love that. And that comes back to a lot of the things we've talked about of talking to customers, looking the data, actually having the firsthand information on what people need and what people want from your product.
Chris Miller :
Yeah, absolutely.
Lenny :
Okay. I'm just going to ask two more, and I'll let you go. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?
Chris Miller :
I fell in love with golf right before the pandemic, but the pandemic really is when I lost my mind and was obsessed with golf. It was one of the few safe things that you could do outside that was social and less dangerous than getting a drink with your buddy at the bar. That's the joke. It's like men invented golf so they could go on walks with each other, and that's essentially what kind of drove the interest in golf. And I also was horrible at it when I first started.
:
And so I think also as you get older and maybe you get more established in your career, or I've been in a product-led growth sort of lane for a while. You almost forget what it's like to be really bad at something until you have a kid and then everything's new and you're failing every day.
:
But golf was a refreshing, consistent experience of frustration and inadequacy and just really embracing that and just waiting in it for a while knowing that it's just going to take cycles and time to get better and better. It was something I got really addicted to, and so I tried to play golf whenever I can, and most recently I bought a Garmin watch, and that thing is just magical. You roll up to the first tee box, you look at your watch, it knows exactly where you are, which golf course. Sometimes it'll even tell you which tees you're at, because in golf sometimes you're further back and sometimes you're further ahead, and it tracks your swings, it tells you distances.
Lenny :
That's insane.
Chris Miller :
It reads the greens for you.
Lenny :
Wow. I just want to play golf just to use that watch.
Chris Miller :
Oh my gosh, some of the guys that I golf with, a couple of them had one recently and I just was enthralled by it and I literally went home and ordered it that same day. And it's been the coolest product or gadget that I bought in a while.
Lenny :
Damn. I love it. And I was also thinking as you were talking about getting into golf connects back to your relentless curiosity and resilience that you look for in people that you hire. So clearly you have it yourself.
:
Final question, I believe you have a dog named Ferney, which is short for Fernet.
Chris Miller :
Yes.
Lenny :
Okay. So on that note, what is your favorite current cocktail, if it's not just a shot of Fernet?
Chris Miller :
The nightcap is always a shot of Fernet. Sometimes you might mix a little Coca-Cola with that. I think, where do they do that? Is that Spain?
Lenny :
I have not heard of that.
Chris Miller :
Or Argentina. I don't know. It's definitely a country that that's a thing. My wife has been really into really high quality margaritas, made at home, and we're big into Aperol Spritz in the summer, so I would say that that's usually what dominates the happy hour rotation these days.
Lenny :
I just had an Aperol. Is it Aperol? Aperol Spritz, right?
Chris Miller :
Yeah. I'm not good at pronunciation. It's probably one of those two.
Lenny :
I just had that for the first time. It's amazing. That's going to be my new go-to.
Chris Miller :
You had an Aperol Spritz for the first time recently?
Lenny :
Yes. I didn't know what that was.
Chris Miller :
That was like the zeitgeist a couple summers ago and then there, oh man. There's the other one too. The Negroni Sbagliatos are having a moment too. It's like a Negroni with Prosecco. I forget.
Lenny :
Ooh, that sounds amazing. There's so much knowledge to be gained in this podcast episode. Chris, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you a question or two. And two, how can listeners be useful to you?
Chris Miller :
You can connect with me on LinkedIn. Shoot me a message. Christopher Miller. There's a lot of Christopher Millers. I'm the one that looks like me, works for HubSpot. I have a Twitter. I don't spend ton of time... X. I have an X account, but I don't spend a lot of time on the app, formerly known as the bird app, but I'm on Instagram @millsyjoeyoung, which is a nod to one of my favorite old monster films, Mighty Joe Young. And so yeah, I'm on Instagram a bunch, too. That's where you can find me.
Lenny :
Then I know two other things that you wanted to share. One is that you advise on PLG and things like that, so maybe talk about that real briefly. And then also you're hiring at HubSpot, or can people know about that?
Chris Miller :
I definitely do a bit of angel investing and advising companies on the side, and I really enjoy it. I think there's something really cool and awesome about getting to see fresh problems all the time and not necessarily being so laser focused on the sort of categories or verticals or target customers that you're dealing with for 40 plus hours a week. And so it's kind of refreshing to spend time with founders who are working on products in different categories and having different challenges at different stages of growth and being able to figure out how I can be a resource to them. And so if you're looking for, if that sounds interesting to you, you're a founder or head of product out there, definitely reach out and maybe opportunities for us to collaborate and maybe that can be a resource.
Lenny :
Cool. And then on the hiring front, any specific roles you want people to know about that you might be hiring?
Chris Miller :
There'll definitely be more roles opening up in the fall, but I think most immediately I'll be looking for a group product manager to work on the AI platform team that I'm leading.
Lenny :
What a role.
Chris Miller :
Yeah, it's a great role with a fantastic team and a space that might be a little important these days. And so if you go to the HubSpot job site, that role should be there by the time this podcast is live. That role should definitely be up there.
Lenny :
Amazing. Chris, thank you again for being here.
Chris Miller :
Lenny, pleasure. Thank you for having me. This has been amazing.
Lenny :
Bye, everyone.
