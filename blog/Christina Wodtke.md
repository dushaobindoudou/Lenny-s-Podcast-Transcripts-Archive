## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### I think there are some things that are fundamentally human that are built into our genes. Storytelling's one. If all of human history was a clock, we started writing things down at 11

00 PM, so most of human history has been an oral tradition where we told each other stories to help pass on knowledge. And so, don't get anywhere near the big kitty with the great big teeth because you will die, or don't eat those red berries because my grandfather threw up for three days and then croaked. But we tell them better than that. Longer stories tend to have more conflicts and they tend to be seen as having more information. So, if you use storytelling, you're talking to the most ancie...

### So, you have these [inaudible 00

47:26] bookends and I think if you only do that, you're probably in good shape. I think status emails, I hated them so profoundly for most of my life. I had this huge team at MySpace and my project manager would gather everybody's status emails and put them together into this giant status email that I had to send to my boss. And I was so busy, I just sent it forward figuring it was fine. And then I read it and there was this really bad thing in my status email that should not have happened.

I ...

### Wow. Okay. [inaudible 00

52:19].
Christina Wodtke :
That's the thing, is Google, even as a huge company, everybody's OKRs and their weekly updates are on their intranet. You can look stuff up, so why not?
Lenny :
Got it. And we'll link to a template that you have on your blog post. And also I think in the book, I imagine you have this template of what it is, but essentially it's your confidence level of hitting your OKR, what you did last week, what you're going to do next week.
Christina Wodtke :
And then a few notes i...

Christina Wodtke :
Because they're smart, they're capable, and if anybody's going to figure out how to make it work, they will. If you try to fix a bad team with OKRs, you'll make everybody hate OKRs and make the bad team worse. So, just don't do that. It's not a medicine, but that high preferring team, they're going to be the ones who go, "Oh, well, okay, our stand-up's like this, so we should add this to standup. And then instead of emails, let's just have a brag channel on our.....

Christina Wodtke :
Radical Focus. Get the second edition. The Team That Managed Itself. And Pencil Me In. Those are my three books that are out there right now. You can get them pretty much anywhere I do believe, but definitely, I mean Amazon. Amazon rules us all, so they're definitely there.
Lenny :
Amazing. Christina, again, thank you for being here. We'll all go slow down right now.
Christina Wodtke :
Thank you so much for having me here, Lenny, and sharing your audience with me. It's...

**I have more questions I want to ask you about OKRs, but you were talking about storytelling and fables and things like that. So, you also wrote a book about, not that we're going to go through all your books, but you wrote a book about drawing and the power of drawing, and also you just believe in storytelling as a really powerful tool. So, I'd love to hear just your take on why storytelling is so powerful and why skilled drawing is so important for product leaders at the [inaudible 00**:

40:48].
Christina Wodtke :

**I think there are some things that are fundamentally human that are built into our genes. Storytelling's one. If all of human history was a clock, we started writing things down at 11**:

00 PM, so most of human history has been an oral tradition where we told each other stories to help pass on knowledge. And so, don't get anywhere near the big kitty with the great big teeth because you will die, or don't eat those red berries because my grandfather threw up for three days and then croaked. But we tell them better than that. Longer stories tend to have more conflicts and they tend to be seen as having more information. So, if you use storytelling, you're talking to the most ancient part of the human brain and you will get attention, you'll get comprehension and you'll get retention. The teacher's Holy Trinity, right?. So, I love stories. They work well, they catch people's attention.
:
And one thing I read that kind of blew my mind was, they said that if you tell people a bunch of facts, they'll forget most of them, especially those that don't fit into their current mental model of how the world works. But if you tell them a story that's full of facts, they will remember it. And if you look at TED, everybody loves a TED Talk. They're mostly all just stories, and facts sprinkled inside those stories. So, I think stories are very powerful. I think images are very powerful. Words are very abstract. If I say the word chair, what pops into your brain? Was it a big easy chair? Was it a hard wooden chair? We use these words as if everybody knows what we're talking about, but people don't.
:
So, in my time in industry, because I was at, what, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Zynga, MySpace, stuff like that, I just found if I got on the whiteboard and drew really badly, and I think it's almost important to draw badly, make some marks, make some squares. Somebody else will go, "No, no, no, it doesn't work that way. Give me this pen," and start doing it. And it gets you so fast to a shared vision of what's going on. I know designers spend all this time making wireframes and I'm like, that's the lamest use of time ever. Just get some whiteboards, go into the room with your engineers and start making some marks together and that just works better.
:
And I found that for some reason in America, people seem to think that you have to be one of the chosen few and born a drawer. But it's like anything, it's like playing piano, you just got to practice a little bit. So, the book mostly just has some really simple things you can draw, and then it tells you how to use them in business. So, I wanted to make something that was even simpler than Back of the Napkin, which is an awesome book, but gets pretty intense, pretty quickly.
Lenny :
With the storytelling piece, I feel like most people are like, "Yes, I know storytelling is powerful." But they don't know how to do it. Is there one tip you could share? Just how to get a little bit better at storytelling or integrate storytelling into your work as a product leader or founder?
Christina Wodtke :
If you say one tip, you're really holding me down. I would say-
Lenny :
You could do two tips if that makes it easier.
Christina Wodtke :
... when you finish telling a story, if you're telling it to someone you can trust, say, "What's something I could have done to make the story better?" You're going to find out, do I just blather on forever, or do I not give enough details? I mean, if you're only going to do one thing, get feedback, is always the answer. The second tip would be structurally there's a beginning, middle, and end. Intrigue people with a hook, a mystery. That's the beginning, right? A mystery, a secret, a surprise. The middle is, you can tell them a little bit about it. That's where you get your message in. If you're trying to pitch something, sneak your product in, whatever. And the end is always going to be success and celebration because you're trying to get people excited about your story or remember this information. So, just a basic structure in your head really, can kind of make a big difference.
Lenny :
Yeah, I love that. That's such a actionable, straightforward tactic for getting better, just ask people, "How could this have been a better story?" Great idea. Your second piece made me think about the Minto Pyramid. Do you know much about, do you work with that at all? The Minto Pyramid principle?
Christina Wodtke :
I had a Minto binge for a little while, but I moved onto other stuff. I do.
Lenny :
I think it was a triangle.
Christina Wodtke :
Yes, but I can't recount it to you. I do remember it.
Lenny :
I was just going to ask because it's kind of the reverse concept, which is, you start with the conclusion and then you kind of share how you got there.
Christina Wodtke :
I think that's a good one. I mean, if you think about what's the job of a hook, a hook just gets you excited. So, how do you get people excited? You can start with a conclusion. There's going to be success. Oh, tell me more. I want to be successful. It could be a mystery. Ooh, what's happening there? I want to be part of that. It could be a secret. Something happened and I'm not going to tell anybody else, but I'm going to tell you. There's so many ways to hook people in, but they're all doing the same job because you want people to actually listen to you and not pretend and nod. So, I think you can do it backwards as well. But I bet even when Barbara Minto did it, she probably opened with a success and ended with a success, I would bet good money, to remind people that there's a happy ending and the story's worth following.
Lenny :
That's a really interesting perspective because to me, there were opposites of build tension and you reveal the answer. The Minto approach is start with the answer. Here's what we're going to do and here's why, and here's all the work I did to get there. Your point is, that's also really interesting. You're like, "Oh wow. I don't know how you got to that."
Christina Wodtke :
There's so many ways to tell a story. Just don't bore your users.
Lenny :
Great advice. Okay, I want to come back to a couple more OKR questions. It could be less fun than the story maybe, but hopefully more useful. I want to just get your take on what is the cadence of a healthy OKR process? What are the ceremonies and meetings and emails that are involved? I know you have this kind of weekly status email practice. Do you recommend... How do you describe the system of an OKR process?
Christina Wodtke :
Oh my gosh, I'm glad you asked because I think the cadence is probably the single most valuable piece of it. So, every Monday, because Monday is a great temporal landmark, look at your week, and you go, "Okay, what am I going to do to move the ball forward?" And it could be an email to your boss, it could be an email to your accountability group, could be an email out to your team, could be standing there like standup. I mean, it's very easy. OKR rituals were built on agile rituals. So, there's a lot of connections there, which is great.
:
So, you just, Mondays you commit and Fridays you celebrate. People do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, "Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations. And oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better." The simple act of getting together and saying, "What was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week? What's the most awesome thing that happened in marketing? What's the most awesome thing that design did this week?" It makes people feel like they're part of something really special and it's super exciting.
:

**So, you have these [inaudible 00**:

47:26] bookends and I think if you only do that, you're probably in good shape. I think status emails, I hated them so profoundly for most of my life. I had this huge team at MySpace and my project manager would gather everybody's status emails and put them together into this giant status email that I had to send to my boss. And I was so busy, I just sent it forward figuring it was fine. And then I read it and there was this really bad thing in my status email that should not have happened.
:
I was like, "Fuck." And I waited to hear back from my boss, and nothing. Apparently he wasn't reading them either. So, I was like, "What's the point of the stupid thing?" And then when I was at Zynga, we were using OKRs and they were really short. They were like, "What's your confidence level on your key results? What did you do last week? And what are you doing next week?" And the last week, next week is great because it allows you to start noting down what stops you from getting shit done. And that, I got to say, there's so much learning in that. I tried to do this, but what? Did I get sick? Did somebody get mad at me? Did somebody not want to work with me? Do we not have this critical database? The whole, I tried to do this last week and I failed, learning goes through the roof.
:
And that rhythm of just having three P1s, you can't have more than three P1s. You can have as many P2s as you want and P3s if you really think you should, but you can scam it... scam it. You can skim it, right? Go through it really quickly. And we would all send them to emails. You could subscribe to email lists, which meant I could read the status emails of most of the company, and I would know what was going on and I could quickly see who should I go over and talk to, and who should I make a connection with? So, those emails were invaluable. I think a lot of my clients are doing it in Slack now instead. And that works really well, if you have this place where you're putting your status in and people will quickly go, skim, skim, skim, skim. "Oh, okay. I got to talk to that guy." So, it's hyper valuable.
Lenny :
If you assume others, the OKR doc, you're like, "Here's our outcomes for the quarter. Here's our three key results." You make that plan once a quarter. You have any recommendation how long to spend on planning your OKR?
Christina Wodtke :
My goal is always as little as possible. Time you're planning is not the time you're shipping, and the best is the enemy of the good. So, in an ideal world, you would grade your OKRs week at the end of the quarter, maybe second to the last week of the quarter, depending on it. If it takes you a whole week to set OKRs, which I hope it doesn't, but who knows. And then the very last week you set your OKRs for the next quarter and that's it.
Lenny :
Cool.
Christina Wodtke :
Boom. If you can do it at in a... usually you can do it in four days total, unless you have a very hierarchal, huge deep bench. And even then, I have something, I'm going to share this with you because I don't think many people talk about this. The approval process will kill you. I've seen it happen over and over again. I was working with one of my clients and we came up with this different kind of approval process that's working really well, is that basically instead of having your boss approve it, you write your OKRs, you get three... I'm a big fan of the rule of three, because I'm a storyteller, but you could do less or more, I guess, teams that work with you enough to know what you're up to, to look them over and they just look them over, 24 hour turnaround.
:
They say, "This looks right, but I don't think this is possible." They give you that feedback and you're done. That's it. That's the entire approval process, and it's so fast and it works so well. And that means you might have to say no to somebody if they're asking you to do more than... if you had 10 teams asking you to look over their OKRs, you have to say no. You want to keep it down to a reasonable number, but if you do one a day, it could be done in a week.
Lenny :
I'm thinking about companies the size of Airbnb when I left, trying to do it that quickly. And it's hard to imagine, partly because there's top level strategy that has to align with individual team roadmaps and dependencies, and platform teams and things like that. So, I imagine it's hard to do as the company's scales. I like the drive to make it a week and be done.
Christina Wodtke :
Well, I mean, who really has to approve it and what does it cost you if you get it wrong? And so, if tech looked at it, if somebody from strategy looked at it, if somebody from sales looked at it, whatever, the right people looked at it, you're probably fine. And if you're not right, you'll figure it out over the quarter and do better next quarter. We have to let go or we will get mired down in all this crap.
Lenny :
I love that. I went off track, but just to kind of put a ribbon on the concept of OKRs, you have this document with your object, your outcomes, your key results, and then your recommendation is do a weekly email. And is the idea everyone on the team sends this weekly email or Slacks to the rest of the team?
Christina Wodtke :
To the rest of the company if you can.
Lenny :

**Wow. Okay. [inaudible 00**:

52:19].
Christina Wodtke :
That's the thing, is Google, even as a huge company, everybody's OKRs and their weekly updates are on their intranet. You can look stuff up, so why not?
Lenny :
Got it. And we'll link to a template that you have on your blog post. And also I think in the book, I imagine you have this template of what it is, but essentially it's your confidence level of hitting your OKR, what you did last week, what you're going to do next week.
Christina Wodtke :
And then a few notes if you need to.
Lenny :
Does this replace stand-ups in your experience?
Christina Wodtke :
It could. I never try to tell engineering how to get their shit done, but if they felt like it was doing the same job, then they could combine them.
Lenny :
Cool. Okay, great. And is there anything else? Is this the whole OKR process, in your experience?
Christina Wodtke :
The only other thing I would bring up is thinking about the word grading. So, a lot of people think about trying to make something really numerical, like 0.08, I got 80% of the way there, but a lot of times they're qualitative. So, how do you think about that getting approved by the product committee? So, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Don't get fussy. Don't try to make it really precise. Just go ahead and say, "Ah, hand wave, hand wave, 80%." What matters is, why 80%? Really focus on the learning. So, we almost got there. Well, if we would've gotten there, if we got two more days, that's fine. We basically got there. We knew what we were doing. If we didn't, if we were really far away, what went wrong?
:
It's all about the retrospectives. Make sure your grading is secondary to retrospective, is the biggest thing I would say, because that's what's going to be valuable. And you could spend so many hours trying to come up with some fake measurement system that never is quite accurate and just wastes everybody's time when you could just be faster. I'm just obsessed with speed. You may have noticed that.
Lenny :
I thought it was 70%, is that 80% is success? Is that the rule of thumb for OKRs?
Christina Wodtke :
It's about 70%. Some people do 80%, some people do 0.075, I don't know. My feeling is, a good goal is one that makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable but not doomed. You're like, "Woo, that's kind of good, that's going to be tricky. Okay, let's go for it." That's about where I like to land with a key result.
Lenny :
I had a newsletter post with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he made this point that OKRs were created by Google, which is the most incredible business model in history. They just print money, and for them it's okay not to hit their goals, like 70% of goal is fine, it'll be fine, we're making so much money. And so, his perspective for most companies, it doesn't make sense to set the goal to be like 70% of this goal you set is a success. Do you have a perspective on that?
Christina Wodtke :
I think you'll never know what you're capable of unless you try to do something that you're not sure you can do.
Lenny :
I agree. I find setting more ambitious goals than you think you can immediately achieve actually really pushes you to achieve them.
Christina Wodtke :
And the literature agrees. There's a lot of literature that shows ambitious goals are actually quite motivating unless you feel you're doomed, at which point then they're demotivating.
Lenny :
I've seen that too. Okay, two more OKR questions. One is, I noted this from before so I'm just going to come back to it. There's a balance with key results of, as you've talked about, being very precise and metrics-driven and focused. And then there's, you talked a bit about sometimes it's okay for them to be a little fuzzy, like quality and delight, and those latter ones are harder to measure, it's hard to keep people accountable. Do you have any advice for just how to find that right balance of, this is what will keep you accountable, and this is how we drive the business forward, and this is how we know you're doing a good job, versus here's a general thing that we think is success and it's fine. Do your best.
Christina Wodtke :
Yeah. One of the most common arguments I have with my friends is I think everything can be measured to a certain degree. Not precisely necessarily, but you can get enough of a swag to be useful. So, by trying to measure things, you'll start learning how to measure things. So, you maybe try NPS and you're like, "Wow, this is not actually accurate, or weird, or not." There's a lot of stuff we don't know until we try them. And of course, my background is in lean and agile and design and they're all iterative. They're all about, let's try something and then learn something and then do something. Which is why I'm so fanatically iterative. So, I think that when you got these fuzzy things, you just got to start trying out ways to measure it and trust the team to be able to figure out whether it's working or not.
:
Revenue, it's easy. This is what we're making now, this is what we could be making. Or you're not making anything now, so you can look up some numbers from public companies or whatnot. That's easy. DAU, it's easy. Acquisition numbers, it's easy. But when it comes to will people stay, do people actually like this? That's harder, but it's not impossible. There's a lot of user researchers who have worked hard to figure out how to measure it.
:
So, you can either buy the obvious off-the-rack package like an NPS, or you can dig a little harder and figure out what would be meaningful to your company. And I think there's a desire not to do things that are hard and take a little bit longer, but that's where you're going to get the super value. That's how you become the next Netflix or Amazon or whatnot. So, you really got to say, "How will we know about our product and what are the approaches are out there and which one makes sense for us?"
Lenny :
Final OKR-related question. Say someone's listening to this and they're like, "Wow, this is awesome. I want to do this at our company, we have a focus problem, we have alignment problems, we need to be more clear about what we're working on." Other than buying your book and reading it and sharing with everyone, what would you recommend would be the first few steps to work along that journey to rolling out an OKR process at the company?
Christina Wodtke :
I hate to say this, but there are a lot of consultants that have popped out of nowhere and it's kind of terrifying because so many of them really, really suck and they're just like, "Oh, OKR sounds like SMART goals or whatever, I'll just use that." Or it's hot, and so I'm going to figure it out by reading some articles. And so, I would ask for references. I think that's a good one.
Lenny :
So, your advice is find someone to come in and help you figure out how to do this well and find the right person.
Christina Wodtke :
Yeah, I guess I think that finding someone to coach you is really high value, but I also think it would be okay if you just read a book or read a bunch of blog posts and start experimenting. It's not rocket science. You just listened to this podcast, listen to it again. Take lots of notes, Google around, see if you can learn a little more about some of the concepts that you didn't fully understand or you want to know more about. And then just run a tiny pilot and say, "Okay, what does this mean for us?" You don't even have to call them OKRs. You can just try, "We're going to do a outcome focus this quarter and let's see where it takes us." But just try it because that's where you learn stuff. And try it at a small, safe level where you don't think it's going to hurt too many things.
Lenny :
And you said to start with a high performing team.
Christina Wodtke :
Oh, yes.
Lenny :

**[inaudible 00**:

59:28] point.
Christina Wodtke :
Because they're smart, they're capable, and if anybody's going to figure out how to make it work, they will. If you try to fix a bad team with OKRs, you'll make everybody hate OKRs and make the bad team worse. So, just don't do that. It's not a medicine, but that high preferring team, they're going to be the ones who go, "Oh, well, okay, our stand-up's like this, so we should add this to standup. And then instead of emails, let's just have a brag channel on our..." I've seen people do the coolest stuff with OKRs, totally changing what I recommend, doing wonderful things with it, just because they're smart and they messed with it till it worked.
Lenny :
Awesome. Final question in topic. You teach product management at Stanford. What's maybe a surprising or contrarian opinion about how to learn to do product management, how to get into product management, how to do product management, from your experience teaching young PMs?
Christina Wodtke :
I taught it and a bunch of students who thought they were going to be product managers realized that they wanted to be interaction designers and not product managers at all. I think one of the things that might be off with a lot of the product management education and conferences is, it's good that they take a lot from UX and it is important to be people-centered, but the reality is the product manager serves the business. That's their role. Teresa Torres talks about the product trio, right? Trio.
Lenny :
Trio.
Christina Wodtke :
Trio. She's talking about business and user experience and technology. So, if product's over here messing with the user experience or products over there, messing with engineering, who's taking care of the business? And I think it's absolutely critical product managers, they say they're the mini CEO, but that just means they want to be in charge and nobody's in charge. It's all about working together as a team. So, they need to understand business models, they need to understand how to do a target market, and what is a target market, why is that target market the right one to go after, and how is it going to grow, and what are the trends that are going on that's going to change the business?
:
Product managers need to serve the business and it's not a bad thing. If you have a company, it needs to survive and all money is, is oxygen, it lets the company keep going, unless people are being greedy assholes, which definitely happens. But it's okay to care about the health and well-being of the company's ability to make money and feed itself. And don't do anything unethical, but really focus on these questions. And if you don't know business models, if you can't talk about why you might want to do a subscription or if you want to just do one-off sales, if you don't understand why you know have all these in-app purchases in your mobile devices, go learn it. I'm really shocked at how many product managers are just smart people who care about users and just showed up and said, "Yes, I will be a product manager." So, no, business is a real thing. It has a long history of knowledge and understanding, and go do that.
Lenny :
What I'm hearing is, maybe product sense is overrated in your experience.
Christina Wodtke :
Ain't none of them yet old enough to have product sense. I mean, seriously. Product sense is intuition, intuition is compressed experience, compressed experience comes from having lots of experience. And if you're young and you don't have a lot of experience, the smartest thing you could do is learn. You've got to learn what models work and why they work, and just intuition is overvalued and under-exists.
Lenny :
Imagine that's kind of freeing to a lot of people listening, where they're like, "Man, I just don't know if I have product sense. How do I learn product?" All this. Yeah, don't worry about it is what you're saying. Any other advice for just people thinking about getting into product or trying to get into product other... Many can't get to Stanford and learn product from someone like you. What else would you suggest they do to try to help them get into a product management role? What other activities or areas they should spend time, in your experience?
Christina Wodtke :
I think I agree with my friend Ken Norton on this, in that you shouldn't probably start in product. Go be an engineer or be a designer, work, get to know businesses. And I got into product from, well, I was a developer and then I was a designer, and both of those gave me a lot of knowledge. But when I moved into product, it came out of my startup where I had to learn business, and I absolutely had to learn business or else I wasn't surviving. So, I would say work for a company that's small enough that you can poke into the corners and learn from other people, and learn and then do stuff.
:
I don't know, it's funny because I'm at Stanford, which is all fancy with a degree and stuff and I'm like, "No, no, no, just read up, go hang out with people, get a job, figure it out." Because that's very much how I did it. And I think that if people want to get into product, I'd ask, "Why? Why do you want to be in product? Do you want to be in charge?" I learned that nobody's in charge. No matter what you do, you have to use your influence, you have to use your people skills.
:
Are you willing to work on your interpersonal dynamics? Because if you can't fire someone, if you can't tell somebody their behavior is interfering with the ability to get things done, don't be a product manager. If you can't solve the fight between two of your coworkers, don't be a product manager. If you can't go out and talk to somebody in a Starbucks line and say, "Hey, we're working on this new thing, what do you think?" Don't be a product manager. You got to have hustle. You got to talk to people. You got to always have your eye on the bottom line.
:

**Maybe you don't want to be a product manager. Maybe it's much more fun to leave work every day at 6**:

00 and be a designer and think about how all the systems work and how and where the error message is going to come in, and is blue the right color, all the combinations of that, that's fun. Or you really want to be an engineer and solve puzzles all day. Product manager is probably the worst job unless you love talking to everybody and connecting them and stepping into the mess.
Lenny :
I definitely agree. There's not enough talk about how painful and hard the PM role is and how thankless it often is.
Christina Wodtke :
And I love it, but I love everything. I fell in love with the web and I haven't stopped, even though it's now mostly on phones and stuff. It's an exciting space. But yeah, you got to step up and do the hard stuff.
Lenny :
That is an awesome way to end it. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I just have six quick questions. I don't know if you know they are, so let's just go through them and see how it goes. Are you ready?
Christina Wodtke :
I love it.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?
Christina Wodtke :
The Fearless Organization. I think that book on psychological safety is the bomb. It's so, so, so good. For fiction, I loved The Overstory. It's about trees, and it's mind-blowing and so good. I'm going to leave it at that. Less is better.
Lenny :
I tried reading The Overstory and it's very long, but beautiful.
Christina Wodtke :
It's a lot like Cloud Atlas. If you liked Cloud Atlas, you'll like The Overstory.
Lenny :
I think I watched that movie.
Christina Wodtke :
No, a terrible movie. Only read the book.
Lenny :
I agree. Speaking of movies, what's a favorite recent movie or TV show?
Christina Wodtke :
We just saw Wakanda Forever and it's a very different movie than Black Panther, and my kid and I spent quite a bit of time talking about it and what it meant and it was a lot deeper than I expected. And I'm very passionate about the Mayan people because I live in Belize part of the year, and I don't know, the Mayans are just the OGs of everything, invented zero, writing. They're just so amazing.
Lenny :
Love it. Next question, favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people.
Christina Wodtke :
What questions should I have asked you? I've been using that one forever, whether I am interviewing somebody or being interviewed, because the person is an expert in themselves. And if you say, "What question should I have asked you?" A lot of times they'll be like, "Oof." They'll be knocked off-base and then they'll give you a really honest answer.
Lenny :
What are five SaaS products or tools that you just love and use constantly?
Christina Wodtke :
Oh, I hate all technology. That's what the problem is, if you've been a product manager and a designer, all you can see is the flaws. But I would say I like Zoom better than you might think. It's terrible, but it's better than everything else. Slack, when I saw it, I was like, "This is not going to get rid of email. This is just going to be another channel of nonsense." And that showed up. But I do use it. God knows, I use it.
:
The Google Suites, I got to say the Google Suite is pretty amazing. Most people think that the students who go to Stanford are all rich, but 70% of them have huge amounts of financial aid. And so, I'm always looking for things that are free and won't cost too much for these students. So many of them are first generation, the first student who's gone in their family here. So, having the Google Suite and being able to have free slides, free docs, everything interconnected, Drive is sort of a gift. So, I've got to say I love those.
Lenny :
Cool. I didn't expect the question to go in that direction, but I love it. Two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've seen a company you've worked with change in their product development process that's had a tremendous impact on their ability to execute and ship crates?
Christina Wodtke :
I will never forget when people stopped sitting with their disciplines and started sitting with their teams. I think that we in tech want everything to be tech and be remote and everything, blah, blah, blah. And there are definitely jobs that are wonderful remote, but if you're trying to innovate, there's nothing like getting the product trio to sit together, and preferably with walls. Walls are really underrated. If you can just give them a war room where they can put stuff on the wall, or I hate to say it, cubicles, I'd rather see offices, but if you can give people walls, it becomes part of your memory. And then you're not using your short-term memory to remember stuff. You're using it to think, and so the war room becomes a living memory so you can make connections. I mean, it's one of the hardest things I have to teach my students too, is that some things are just better done analog and that's okay.
Lenny :
Reminds me of a story I just heard from a friend where there was a team sitting next to a data science team and they were one table apart. They're right next to each other. And the data team just had a lot of concerns with what that team was building. They didn't believe in what they're doing and they're just like, "Why are we wasting these resources on this thing?" And the head of data science put one of the data people on the team and had them sit just one table over with the team and everything changed. They're just like, "Okay, let's do this. This is great. We're going to build some awesome products."
Christina Wodtke :
We're human.
Lenny :
Just that one move.
Christina Wodtke :
We are human. We are social. Yeah, and I think moving people around every year or so, everybody hates it. Nobody wants to change desks, but do it to them anyway. It always makes things better.
Lenny :
Final question. What's a company that you think has a really strong and effective product culture? If you can name one, if not, that's okay too.
Christina Wodtke :
Well, I think of all my clients, the best cultures all seem to be very small companies working in strange little corners of the world. They're not the big, sexy guys. Everybody's there because they want to make dog food or they want to make this kind of financial software, and they're amazing. I think we treat scale like it's a virtue when it's merely a tactic, and it might be a bad tactic as well. So yeah, I think there's something really sweet around 250 people working on something that everybody agrees is important.
Lenny :
Christina, I honor you as emperor for life of OKRs.
Christina Wodtke :
Woo.
Lenny :
You've achieved it. I'm very proud of you. I think we've made a big dent in how people perceive OKRs and will utilize OKRs.
Christina Wodtke :
I hope so.
Lenny :
Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Christina Wodtke :
If they want to learn more, I've been blogging at eleganthack.com, like a hack writer since 2000. It's where I've dumped my thoughts for a long time, so it's always a good place if you want to go spelunking about anything. If you want to attempt to hire me, cwodtke.com is not a bad place to go. I say attempt because I teach, and so I don't have a lot of time. But you know what users could do? Users could slow down. I just wish everybody would take a deep breath and think about, "Okay, we're going to adopt this thing. Let's read up on it. Let's think about it. Oh, we're going to build this new product? Let's do a literature review, let's do a competitive analysis. Let's see what's been done. Let's learn from the past."
:
I think if you could slow down, you'll end up going a lot faster. So, I would encourage people, if you're in a panic and you're in a tizzy, and I know the economics bad and the world's on fire, but just take some deep breaths before you do anything and just ask yourself, "What's a good way to do it? What's a good way for me to move forward?" I think I would like to encourage that.
Lenny :

**A beautiful way to end it, but I also want to make sure you plug your books. Just say the titles of your books and where people can find them, and then we'll [inaudible 01**:

12:24].
Christina Wodtke :
Radical Focus. Get the second edition. The Team That Managed Itself. And Pencil Me In. Those are my three books that are out there right now. You can get them pretty much anywhere I do believe, but definitely, I mean Amazon. Amazon rules us all, so they're definitely there.
Lenny :
Amazing. Christina, again, thank you for being here. We'll all go slow down right now.
Christina Wodtke :
Thank you so much for having me here, Lenny, and sharing your audience with me. It's been an honor.
