## Key Takeaways | 核心要点

### Just tell us all of the secrets. And that [inaudible 00

45:38] know.
Maggie Crowley :
The toast PR department would be really unhappy with me. It's questions like, if you're a director of product somewhere, maybe you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going to do next year? How do you answer that question? How do you back up your choices for that? You use a doc like this. Maybe you are realizing that the product that you're working on doesn't really matter, it's not really making an impact. You're k...

### The why this matters now point is so interesting. I don't often hear that and I think it's such an important part of specs and plans and strategies because there's so many things you can do and there's certain things that are perishable that you can only do now. That if you don't do now you miss up the opportunity. And so I think that's a really interesting element that most people don't include and it reminds me of, I think I've done enough podcast episodes now where I'm just connecting all these things as people are talking. [inaudible 00

53:16] the John Nash thing happening where Karri, the founder of Linear talked about this concept of side quests as a founder. Because he's so good at staying focused and I was just like, "How do you stay focused and just get stuff done when you have so many people coming out?" He's just like, "There's the main quest and then there's the side quests and side quest I don't need to do right now. There's the main quest which is build up really successful business." And I feel like this is a good ex...

### Yeah, and maybe it's true and that's great. I am not saying that you don't need data. You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that, you need to know why. It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening, I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next. One quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was a VP [inaudible 01

00:24] at TripAdvisor, we were in a room, just had this meeting called product review that was amazing when I first joined and someone was justifying this project and he just, I hope he is okay with me saying this because this is my memory of this moment.
:
He was just like, this is an obviously better thing. Just do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop doing all the stuff that you're doing. Stop with these numbers, whatever it was that they were doing, if it's obviously better, if it's logically better, use...

### I never thought of it or wanted to think of it that way. And I'm just curious what advice you'd give to people that want to go down this route without feeling, I guess one, is just feeling like they're being cringey, and two, avoiding content people be like, oh my God, I can't believe this stuff [inaudible 01

09:02].
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, the clickbait tweet thread situation. I think the step one's going to be cringe. Your first 10, 20, however many posts are going to be bad. I would imagine if you went back and listened to your first episode, you would be cringing just because you've learned so much since then. Right?
Lenny :
Yeah.
Maggie Crowley :
It's natural.
Lenny :

### Although randomly the first episode ever is the most popular episode. So, with [inaudible 01

09:29], which I could see why it was so popular.
Maggie Crowley :
So, it went really hot with your first guest.
Lenny :
That's right. That's right.
Maggie Crowley :
So, yeah, first get over the fact that it's going to be cringe. It's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started and it'll fade away eventually and you don't have to think about it. Two B, this is such gross advice, but you have to be authentic. It has to be real. And I think what came through in the show that I d...

**Just tell us all of the secrets. And that [inaudible 00**:

45:38] know.
Maggie Crowley :
The toast PR department would be really unhappy with me. It's questions like, if you're a director of product somewhere, maybe you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going to do next year? How do you answer that question? How do you back up your choices for that? You use a doc like this. Maybe you are realizing that the product that you're working on doesn't really matter, it's not really making an impact. You're kind of treading water. I would use this as a tool to figure out, okay, well what else could you do? So, yeah, quarterly planning, annual planning. If you feel like your team needs to make a pivot or if you think that there's a really interesting new opportunity that your business or your team should go after, is another time I might use something like this.
Lenny :
Awesome. This reminds me a little bit of, I keep mentioning this chat with Bill Carr that I had who is an early Amazon exec and how the narrative approach at Amazon, one of the benefits of that and the reasons they go there is partly for you to realize this is a bad idea before anyone even needs to give you feedback. And that's why they force you to write six pages in depth about your idea and then it goes in these concentric circles through the company. And idea is like, here's okay, and this is just not a good idea. Here's all the reasons why. So, I think there's a lot of similarities there.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, there are many, many times when if you combine this artifact and process with the point about simplification where through that process you just start cutting so many things because then what happens is, let's say you've gone through this exercise and you're like, okay, I know exactly what my three things are that I want to work on. Then there's a moment where you take the strategy and then you look at your roadmap and they're never the same. And the roadmap is just bloated with all of this random stuff that like, oh, well, we have to do that because of this, or we have to do that because of that.
:
This thing we're still working on, this is like six months delayed, so we're still going to do the thing. And then all of a sudden you've got 90% of your resources committed to things that don't track against your strategy. And it's a really interesting moment as a leader especially to sit there and go, well, what do we do? What do you do when you have that problem? And especially if you're a PM, you probably don't have the agency to say, scrap the entire roadmap and work on my new strategy. But at least it allows you to think about critically about whether you should be doing what you're doing and allows you to evaluate whether those things are still the most important things to work on.
Lenny :
I'm going to summarize the template real quick, and then I'm going to have another question kind of along the lines. So, if you're trying to create your own little template, you start with the mission of the business, and then I imagine you also share the mission of your team because oftentimes it's a little more specific, if you're working on it like a product team strategy. Then there's a landscape of what's happening. So, you include competitive, SWOT analysis of competition risks, product state, business state, things like that.
:
And then you share the current goals of what you're trying to achieve as a team slash business. And there's an account, honest accounting of what's happening in the product and technical hurdles and things like that that'll keep you from moving, I guess, achieving some of these goals. And then you share, here's the opportunity I see, how we win and how we actually achieve this opportunity where we place bets and things like that, or we could place bets. Then challenges of doing this, what needs to be true for this to be possible? And then you finally get to, here's what I think we should do, essentially the solution, ideally three bullet points, and then the plan. And I imagine the plan is step one, get sign off from exec. Step two, resource the team. Step three, start on this design research sprint.
Maggie Crowley :
Pretty much.
Lenny :
Awesome. All right. Amazing. Somebody will create this template if you don't end up doing it.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah.
Lenny :
There's another-
Maggie Crowley :
I hope somebody does.
Lenny :
Okay. That'd be awesome. If they do, I will tweet it and we put it in the show notes.
Maggie Crowley :
Great.
Lenny :
So many promises already from this podcast. Along the same lines, you also have a one-pager template and process that I think people find really useful. So, how about we chat about that one briefly and then I'm going to go in a whole different direction.
Maggie Crowley :
Okay. Yeah, I don't think I have much to say about this. That has not been said by many people many times, but whether it's a spec, a PRD, a one pager, I don't even know what else people call it. It's the document that you use to define the thing that you're doing as a product team, and that means product design, engineering, your little squad. And what I think is really useful about this process is that it's the PM's artifact. So, designers produce designs, engineers write code. What do PMs do? A lot of people might say nothing. In theory, we write at least this document and it can be a pain. I've seen lots of ways where it hasn't been done very well, but when I think it's done really well and when it's really effective is it's a tool that allows the PM to start with why. And if you structure it correctly, the most important section in my opinion in the document is the first part, which is like what is the background and context?
:
What is the problem, why does it matter and why does it matter now? And if you get those things right, the rest gets really easy, but it gives you a chance as a PM to center the team around the problem, why that problem exists, whether it's created by your own product or it's something the user is experiencing and why that problem is worth solving. That's a part that I think people sometimes forget to think about and why it's we're solving right now versus all the other problems you could be solving and then it can become the home base of the decisions that you make along the way. So, I think it's best when you have those sections and then also best when you write down on this day, we made this decision or we decided not to do this or we decided only to solve this part of the problem, not this part of the problem. Keeping a running list of that and a link off to all the different artifacts and research and things is helpful for a team.
Lenny :
So, just to summarize, what would be the headings again, just if someone's taking notes and wants to create the rule template?
Maggie Crowley :
I don't think these templates have to be really complicated. It's like background and context. The problem. I would literally write why this problem matters and why this problem matters now. Don't make it complicated, just answer those questions and if you can do that, and then again, it's only really helpful if then you bring that document before you go any further to your team and you use it to have a conversation and you get the smart people around you to take shots at it. I should have mentioned this earlier with the strategy. The first person I go to is typically speaking my engineering counterpart and I say, shred this, go through it, rip it apart, vomit comments on it, tear this down how it gets better. And as a PM you can't be precious about your work. You need people to poke holes in it.
Lenny :

**The why this matters now point is so interesting. I don't often hear that and I think it's such an important part of specs and plans and strategies because there's so many things you can do and there's certain things that are perishable that you can only do now. That if you don't do now you miss up the opportunity. And so I think that's a really interesting element that most people don't include and it reminds me of, I think I've done enough podcast episodes now where I'm just connecting all these things as people are talking. [inaudible 00**:

53:16] the John Nash thing happening where Karri, the founder of Linear talked about this concept of side quests as a founder. Because he's so good at staying focused and I was just like, "How do you stay focused and just get stuff done when you have so many people coming out?" He's just like, "There's the main quest and then there's the side quests and side quest I don't need to do right now. There's the main quest which is build up really successful business." And I feel like this is a good example of that in action.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, I love his take on quality and taste too.
Lenny :
Yeah. What a gem.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, big fan of that. But yeah, I mean it's really hard to stay disciplined, it's hard to stay focused and to your point, there's a million things you could do at any given time, especially if you work at a bigger company. And so the why now is an important question to answer because if not, somebody's going to ask you. So, you may as well think about it.
Lenny :
Yeah, it's interesting why now comes up a lot in investing in startups but rarely in product building and it feels like it should. Although I will say in the research I've done, why now ends up not being that important for startups being successful or not. So, I think there's a two sides to that coin. Anyway, I'm going to move on to a different topic and this might become a new thing that we do and I'm going to call it contrarian corner. I asked you if you have contrarian opinions about things before we started recording this episode and you had some really good ones. So, there's a couple topics I'm going to chat about and we'll see if this becomes a recurring theme and you're laughing and nodding your head, what are you thinking as I say this?
Maggie Crowley :
I'm thinking about when I had a podcast, you would do a show on a topic and we would click the end recording button and then every single guest would be like, I had no idea what I was doing. I made it all up, it was waterfall. None of that matters. I didn't know what I was ... People would say the wildest stuff and I would sit there as a PM and just think what. We just talked about this framework, we just talked about this thing and that's how you're supposed to do it. And then they would get off the official part and just say, yeah, it's wild. Nothing goes the way you want it to go. We're all just kind of making it up as we go. And so I hope that you get more of those takes in this part of the show.
Lenny :
I'm very sensitive to that point right now because someone just tweeted about how they're just finding that many of my newsletter posts about how companies write product are the ideal version of what they do and I rarely or they rarely share, here's all the challenges we're having, which I think there's truth to that, but I also get into a lot of failures on this podcast. Actually, I think the podcast is a lot more of just here's things that go wrong versus the newsletter. So, I'm just like shit, I need to do more of that. So, I love that you mentioned that and let's see what we can get into. But I guess maybe before we get there, is there an example of something that didn't go just along the lines of some sort of failure slash mistake?
Maggie Crowley :
I might be foreshadowing, but a question I ask in every product interview is what's the worst product you've ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty, you just haven't had enough reps, you haven't done it enough time. And it's not only that you've done it but that you can admit it and which one it is. That's so important. And I remember, it was so dumb, I'm still so mad about this, that we did this. I won't name which team, which company, I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we needed to do a rewrite, red flag number one of a existing product and engineer who I'd worked with many times. We had a really good relationship and this person was like, yeah, yeah, it's going to take six months, no problem.
:
Core part of the product been around for forever. One of those things that the code is still, it's still the code written by the founders kind of thing. It didn't take six months, it took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never, it went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to get to feature parody. It was the worst project. So, many people rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb, sunk cost fallacy, just the worst. And it's because A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it. B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one-pager, we just went for it. We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements would actually have to be. And there you have it.
Lenny :
And did not work out or was it a huge success in the end and it changed the trajectory of the business?
Maggie Crowley :
Absolutely not. But you know what, I didn't get fired, so it's fine.
Lenny :
I feel like I've gone through those experiences and then three, four years later it's like another, maybe this rewrite and redesign may work because we haven't updated this thing in a long time.
Maggie Crowley :
Just don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side by side re-write, nope.
Lenny :
Yeah, what I run into is once you get too far down a redesign slash rewrite everyone's building in that new world and then you launch an experiment's negative and then it's just like, oh, we just got to launch it. We're going to claw back. We're going to get figure out how to get back to neutral someday.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah.
Lenny :
Yeah.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah. Don't do that.
Lenny :
Good times. Okay, well maybe we'll start a failure corner. That could be a new segment. We may have a little sound and theme music, but this time we have contrarian corner and you have a couple contrarian opinions about a couple topics. The first is product management. What is something that you believe about product management that maybe other people are less convinced by?
Maggie Crowley :
The one I like to have in this area is that people who are really excited about being data-driven, to me that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking, especially if it's an executive who's saying things like, oh, so we make all our decisions with our dashboards. To me that says that the team is over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data and they're not using good judgment. They probably don't do a lot of direct user research. They don't really understand the humans who are using the thing, what they need, what they care about, and they're managing via a dashboard. And maybe if they got really, really good at picking metrics, it would be fine. And oftentimes maybe it is fine. Maybe you have a high volume business that's really easy to run experiments on and that works for you. But most PMs, most jobs, most products, you're going to be better off talking to 10 users and you'll get more and better insights out of why things are happening than you would with any dashboard.
Lenny :
So, the takeaway there is just be careful when someone is saying they're super data-driven. Our team is super data-driven or company company's super data-driven.
Maggie Crowley :

**Yeah, and maybe it's true and that's great. I am not saying that you don't need data. You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that, you need to know why. It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening, I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next. One quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was a VP [inaudible 01**:

00:24] at TripAdvisor, we were in a room, just had this meeting called product review that was amazing when I first joined and someone was justifying this project and he just, I hope he is okay with me saying this because this is my memory of this moment.
:
He was just like, this is an obviously better thing. Just do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop doing all the stuff that you're doing. Stop with these numbers, whatever it was that they were doing, if it's obviously better, if it's logically better, use your good judgment and do that thing and let's move on. And I've always thought about that, but you can just do the obviously better thing.
Lenny :
Yeah, I love that I pull that card sometimes, but I think you almost have to do it that way of just like, okay, everyone, this one's just obviously a good idea. Let's just do it. Enough research. Okay, another topic that you have some interesting opinions about his product content very close to our hearts, both my heart and your heart. Do share.
Maggie Crowley :
Really if you're going to make good content, you have to sanitize and frameworkize the thing that you're working on. And then slowly, I think for a lot of people who are reading it and looking at it, their thinking starts to become, well look how well I did this framework. Look how well I implemented this thing. And they lose touch with the point which is creating impact. And so all of this content makes it really noisy and then makes people think that, oh, if I just do these things that I'll get what I want. And now I'll just check off my list and then I checked it off and then I should get my promotion at the end of the day. But it's like the best PMs have built up so many different frameworks and they can apply them in different ways. And then sometimes they throw them out and they say, nothing I have in my toolkit makes sense for this moment, but I know what to do because I have intuition and I have data and I've talked to users or whatever.
:
And so content sometimes can get in the way of the impact because you're trying to apply it and you think that the point is the framework and the point is the one pager or whatever it is that you're doing when it's not. And then if you're a leader and maybe if you've had the good and ill fortune of having published content, someone comes to you and says, well, you said in that one podcast episode that you don't believe in roadmaps, so why are you asking me for a roadmap? And then you're the who's sitting there being like, well, it's a little more complicated than that. And that was a fun take that I had, but I actually need to understand what we're doing because planning and I need to figure out what my budget is, blah, blah, blah.
Lenny :
That's so funny that I didn't think about you as a leader having put stuff out that people put back at you. And I think your point about one for you, for people to consume content online about how to do product management, you have to really distill it. And to your point, it often loses the nuance. Because if you had all the ones, no one's going to even read it so complicated and long. And then the other point of there's also just it has to be interesting. So, if it's another just like, here's how a roadmap really is successfully and it's like what everyone's already done, no one's going to read it. So, you always have to have a new take. And with that comes, it's not actually always true. I just wanted people to react to this idea.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, I mean it's helpful. I think there's some people who create, I mean there's many things at my last role, we all had your newsletter and we listened to the show and then people would bring, I should have found a clip, but I can't remember, there were a couple of moments where we would listen to a piece of it or find an article and say, oh, this could help. Or what if we did it that way? I think there was a newsletter article about Figma and they had some templates. They're like product review template for FigJam. Love that one. Use that one all the time.
Lenny :
Amazing.
Maggie Crowley :
So, yeah, I mean the stuff's really useful. It's just like you have to be smart about when you apply it. And then if you're a leader and there's all this content available, you have to know why you're not following the rules.
Lenny :
If they're just like, hey, look at this newsletter post letting you write, we should be doing it this way. Versus I think people assume these are the one way to do it or innately will work at your company. And I really like your point, which maybe counter to what I do, but I think it's an important nuance that I feel like I should add to every newsletters. This isn't necessarily going to work at your company. Sometimes the culture is different and this won't fit or this isn't a complete version. As much as I try to give people, here's everything you need to do this thing well, there's always a little bit missing
Maggie Crowley :
And I think if you don't have that context, it can be a little demoralizing like, well, how am I ever going to do that thing that they get to do at this magical company? But again, if you view it as more like here all the tools that you can add to your toolkit and you pull them out when you're in a situation from which they can be useful, that's how I think about it. Versus this is the one way to do it like you said, the only way you can write a one page or the only way you can write an experiment, it's more like you can do it in many different ways.
Lenny :
And I find myself, I'm not actually, I rarely tell people here's the way to do it. Usually what I try to describe is here's how the best companies do it, as much as I can get into and leave it to the reader to decide is this going to be a fit for me, should I try to implement it? But still, I think there's an implication. This is the way to do research, here's the way to do roadmap, here's the way to prioritize. But I think it's interesting that you also, yourself create a lot of content and you actually found a lot of value from being, let's not call you content creator because I don't like being labeled as a creator myself.
Maggie Crowley :
Someone one's called me a product influencer and I'll died like a little bit.
Lenny :
That's how I feel. I'd love to hear just the impact you've seen from spending time creating podcasts and blog posts and tweeting about really great stuff because a lot of people are thinking about investing in this stuff.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, it's probably the best thing I've ever done for my career and I am so grateful for the people whose idea it was, who supported me and especially at Drift, when that became such a part of what we were doing at that time. And it's been helpful for a couple of reasons. One is just networking and access. I probably wouldn't be here today if I hadn't done that and if a friend of a friend had read the thing, it's like it just creates so many more connections. And so access to people and networking is one of the first benefits.
:
Also building a personal brand is really helpful if you want, one of the things that I always wanted to do with my career is try to make it so that I'm always employable. I just didn't want to, I'm an 08 grad not to put my age out there, and it was a hard time. And so I've always had this in the back of my mind, you want to be able to have a solid career. And so I thought that investing in my personal brand would be a way to help me get access to roles. It helps in recruiting as well when I'm trying to hire people. Because a lot of my job now is bringing people in and because I've been vocal about how I like to work and who I am, a lot of people and they will send me a note and say, I want to work with you, or I want to work on a team like that.
:
And that's huge because if my job is to hire people, then that's great and people can get a sense of who I am without needing to be on the phone with me. My favorite benefit outside of those things has been that it's helped me learn more from the work I've done than I otherwise would've been able to. Because in order to make content, you have to think through what you did, you have to summarize it, process it, make it interesting for people. And then especially if it's in a podcast meeting, talk to somebody about it. And the process of doing that means that you're paying attention to what you're learning along the way. And so often we don't do that because we're busy working, we have our lives, things are happening. And that to me is, I think what's made me a better product person faster is because I spent the time to think about what I was doing in a way that I wouldn't have if I didn't have to write something down.
Lenny :
Something that comes across in your content that you've somehow figured out is to avoided being cringy and very thirsty for followers. And I think when a lot of people here build a personal brand, it's like, I don't want to.
Maggie Crowley :
I know. It makes me ill even saying that, it's like too gross.
Lenny :

**I never thought of it or wanted to think of it that way. And I'm just curious what advice you'd give to people that want to go down this route without feeling, I guess one, is just feeling like they're being cringey, and two, avoiding content people be like, oh my God, I can't believe this stuff [inaudible 01**:

09:02].
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, the clickbait tweet thread situation. I think the step one's going to be cringe. Your first 10, 20, however many posts are going to be bad. I would imagine if you went back and listened to your first episode, you would be cringing just because you've learned so much since then. Right?
Lenny :
Yeah.
Maggie Crowley :
It's natural.
Lenny :

**Although randomly the first episode ever is the most popular episode. So, with [inaudible 01**:

09:29], which I could see why it was so popular.
Maggie Crowley :
So, it went really hot with your first guest.
Lenny :
That's right. That's right.
Maggie Crowley :
So, yeah, first get over the fact that it's going to be cringe. It's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started and it'll fade away eventually and you don't have to think about it. Two B, this is such gross advice, but you have to be authentic. It has to be real. And I think what came through in the show that I did was those were my real questions that I was really working on.
:
So, we joked about how we would turn off the recording and then we would get the real story, but I would turn the recording off and I would say, okay, we talked about this thing. Here's actually happening in my job today, what would you do? And so those were real questions that I had, real processes that I was working on and real advice that I needed at that time. And I think that's why it was valuable is because I was actively a PM and the way that I'm still actively in product, that was always something that I wanted because it meant that the content had to be relevant for me and wasn't just for likes and share.
Lenny :
I think there's some two really important points there that stood out to me. One is your stuff's going to be terrible if you don't actually have any background or experience in the things, you're just pretending. It's like you're acting like someone that knows about this thing, but you don't actually. And so I think that's an incredibly important part of this is don't try to become an online creator person if you haven't done the thing, because people will see that you don't know what you're really talking about and you'll run out of stuff and it'll be like, okay, well I did it for two months and I have nothing more to say.
Maggie Crowley :
Right.
Lenny :
And then the other piece is there's a guest who shared this quote that has stuck with me from Einstein, which is something like, "Seek not to be successful but of value." And I find that that's a really good framing for sharing stuff is just share things that are interesting to you and useful and come at it from this is useful, not from, I'm trying to build a following. Because people can tell if that's the-
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah, people can absolutely tell. And the other thing is there's a little bit of too cool for school mixed in here and there are definitely people who will tell you your content is cringe or make fun of you or whatever because that's what they want to do. And I'm not even going to get into psychology of that, but people will do that. And I've always been of the mind that the really interesting people out there, people who are unashamedly interested in stuff and who are like, yeah, I'm nerding out about this and I'm sharing it because I'm interested in it. And for better for worse, I love working in product. I love the job.
:
Even all the gross stuff you have to do, it's super interesting. You meet really cool people, you get to ship stuff, you get to see the stuff get used by people and solve problems. It's a really cool job and I've always been interested in how to do it better and it doesn't matter to me that some people might think that's cringe because that's cool, but this is what I do all day long, so I'd like to get better at it.
Lenny :
I think that's such a big part of it. I didn't even mention that. Just it needs to feel really authentic and clearly for you is just like, there's just stuff I want to share because it's really interesting to me.
Maggie Crowley :
Yeah.
Lenny :
The way I actually started writing was exactly the two reasons you just shared. One is I wanted to learn the thing and so writing helped me figure things out. And then two is I just thought it was interesting and I found it useful and I just assumed other people might find it useful. So, I did also learn, and I wonder if you found this too, is that you think the things are not going to be that interesting or useful to people, so basic for you, but people find the most basic stuff so interesting. Because there's always more to learn about how to roadmap, how to prioritize, how to hire, how to talk, to have difficult conversations, performance review.
Maggie Crowley :
All of that is absolutely true. And I think one of the first pieces of content that I was really happy with was I was working with somebody and they were making a PowerPoint presenter slides or whatever, and I just wrote out in my notebook like, okay, here's how I do that. I start with an outline on paper and then I draw little boxes for the slides and I write out the headline of the slides. And then once I have a tight outline and I have the literal text that will go across the top of each of those things, then I sketch out how I want the slides to go. And then I go into Google Docs and I actually make the slide.
:
And it was like some silly little thing and this person sat there and said, holy, you just totally changed the way I did this and this took me 75% less time than it would've taken me otherwise. And I was like, I may do this dumb drawing. Why is this a big deal? And yeah, that's when I realized that the stuff that's easy for you might be a stuff that is most interesting because it's something that maybe you're really good at that you don't realize.
Lenny :
I think people need to really internalize that point. If there's something that you're doing that you consistently find useful and works often, that is going to be really useful for someone to hear. So, that could be a good place to start. Maggie, we've gone through everything that I was hoping to get through and more, which is awesome.
Maggie Crowley :
Great.
Lenny :
Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or touch on think might be useful to leave folks with?
Maggie Crowley :
My hope is always that people listen to stuff like this and realize that it's messier than you think you can fail a lot and still be successful and that they should have fun. I think that gets missed in a lot of the product content is like, have fun, enjoy it. People are weird, people do weird stuff and you build stuff for people, which it makes it all very entertaining. So, I've always found a lot of joy in the job.
Lenny :
And to your point of carrying the water as a PM where you're kind of doing all the things, it's like you can create that fun. You can make the team your own fun and change the culture, create the culture. I find that so underappreciated for PM.
Maggie Crowley :
Absolutely.
Lenny :
Okay, well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Maggie Crowley :
I'm ready.
Lenny :
Maggie, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Maggie Crowley :
First, most common one is probably the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, the little tiny one, really great way to improve your speaking skills and your presentation skills and to get distracted executives to agree with the point you're making. So, that's one. Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke is the second one. Coming back to the point about being able to make bets, I think that one's a really interesting one. And then bonus third one, this is more like a desk reference that I now have on my desk, the Scaling People book by Claire Hughes Johnson. I really enjoyed the way that one is working and it just sits on my desk and I reference it every once in a while, especially as manager.
Lenny :
I have it both under my laptop right where I'm sitting and then also way behind there and it's one of the most popular episodes I've done with Claire, so if folks haven't listened to that one. Highly recommend. She's incredible. Great choice. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?
Maggie Crowley :
Okay, so my husband is in the industry, as we say here in LA, and so we watch a lot of good and bad shows in TV, but I think my favorite one that I've watched recently was Slow Horses. Gary Oldman is incredible. Highly recommend.
Lenny :
Wow, I haven't heard that one yet. Good tip. What is a favorite interview question you really like to ask which I think you already gave away, but let's touch on it again.
Maggie Crowley :
I did. Yeah, it is what is the worst product that you've ever shipped? I think the best answers are ones, and I don't even care if someone listens to this and then I do this in an interview, people immediately laugh a little bit. They remember the horrible thing they did and then they share that horrible thing with you. And it tells me you have some humor, you're humble and you can point out when you've made a mistake. You've done enough to be able to confidently say, of course I've made a mistake. Because none of us are perfect. And you know how to spot those mistakes and you can learn from them. And I've always found that those conversations are the most interesting.
Lenny :
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?
Maggie Crowley :
One because I've seen you on Twitter, you're a future fit guy.
Lenny :
Yeah, I'm.
Maggie Crowley :
Is that correct?
Lenny :
I use it three times a week. I love it.
Maggie Crowley :
Yes. I was also a future fit person. I think it's great. It's a great product. I'm now on Ladder Fit.
Lenny :
I've heard of that.
Maggie Crowley :
And personally, I love not being, I don't have to talk to the coach every day. I don't need the accountability, so that's not a thing that I needed as an ex athlete. So, for me, that didn't serve me and I like the anonymity of it and it comes with a totally unhinged group chat for your whole team. It's fantastic. I'm really enjoying it.
Lenny :
Sweet.
Maggie Crowley :
So, that's one more of a funny one. And the second one, not to get real niche, but I think good products are products that are focused. They do one thing incredibly well and they're not, to your point about side quest, there's no side quests. I'm a new mom. There's this app called Pump Log. I have never seen an execute so well on one problem. There's not a single thing where I think, oh, I wish it did this. It does it. It's like I paid $14 for it. I've never paid for an app like that in my life.
Lenny :
Okay, I'm downloading it right after we finish. Do you have a favorite life motto that you either repeat yourself, often like to share with folks, find useful, and just kind of living life?
Maggie Crowley :
I'm sure there's mottos' I could say that would be aspirational mottos', but the real one is if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. And again, from being in sports to going to school to being in product, in my opinion, if you're going to do something, do it to the best of your ability because that's what you do with your day. You spend so much time working, you may as well be good at it or trying to get good at it. And that's always how I've lived my life.
Lenny :
I so love that message. I always think about that. Final question, you are an Olympic speed skater, which I don't think people would know necessarily. That's insane. My question is there some bad speed skating that would surprise people that would be like, what?
Maggie Crowley :
Ooh, that is one I've never been asked before. The whole experience, I've obviously learned a ton from it, and I think what might surprise people about being a small sport athlete is that you have to think in four or eight year chunks. And so it's one of those things where you grind for so long in a dark corner and then you get a chance to get the light to shine on you and you learn how to love the process. Especially for speed skating, I was a long track speed skater, it's a 400-meter rink.
:
You just are always turning left and going in a circle. There's not a lot going on. It's just you and your thoughts and you just really, really learn how to get good at perfecting something over and over again, and you learn how to grind, you learn how to focus, and I think it's also cool you get to go superfast. But yeah, I don't know if that would surprise people about speed skating, but I think just about being a small sport elite athlete, it's really about years and years and years of toiling and silence to get maybe one shot at something great.
Lenny :
So, much of what you just said would apply 100% to product management and I love that. Maggie, you are awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you any follow-up questions, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?
Maggie Crowley :
You can find me on Twitter for sure. By LinkedIn, but just speaking of cringe, I just can't get into LinkedIn posting.
Lenny :
LinkedIn's gotten better, I'd give it a shot. It's actually pretty interesting now, which sound weird to say.
Maggie Crowley :
Thinking about it, I better go back to work in a couple of weeks and thinking about LinkedIn. But yeah, Twitter for sure, LinkedIn for sure, and I've always tried to be helpful to other people, so I don't have an answer for how people can be helpful to me, my goal is really to share what I've been doing, the rooms that I get to be in, the access to the content and the people and the learning that I've had. So, hopefully I can find ways to keep sharing that.
Lenny :
Maybe check out Toast and use Toast when they're at restaurants.
Maggie Crowley :
Oh yes, Plug, Toast. Come work with us. We're the best. I get to work with John Cutler. It's phenomenal.
Lenny :
Legendary, previous guest. Are there roles you're hiring for just for folks that are listening and just like, hey, maybe I should go do that.
Maggie Crowley :
There are always roles that are open. I don't know what the most open roles are right now, but yeah, check it out. It's a great place.
Lenny :
Willing to the careers page.

Awesome.
