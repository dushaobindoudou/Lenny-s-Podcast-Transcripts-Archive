## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### And so we'll link to this quick check. [inaudible 00

29:02] dora.dev/quickcheck.
Nicole Forsgren :
And by the way, they do not collect your name. They do not collect your info. There's no lead, lead gen, anything. Everything's just there. And then, there's deep dives into every single one of the capabilities.
Lenny :
Amazing. And also your book talks about all these things. So people should go check out the book. Obviously it's on Amazon. Search Accelerate. Is that right?
Nicole Forsgren :
Yep.
Lenny :
Okay. So we were talking about DORA. This may...

### So SPACE is there to help you think about how you want to pick metrics, right. So a lot of time I see people... So [inaudible 00

33:06] half step back. I used to advise people on how to pick metrics. For years people would pull me in to advise on DORA or Accelerate. They would ask me questions, but it ended up being metrics questions a lot. "How do I pick the right metrics to improve what I'm doing?" Like I said, they had the DORA numbers. They would pick their constraints, and they wanted to improve.
:
"But how do I improve? How do I measure this? How do I show improvement?" And so we would start thinking really critical...

### Wow, [inaudible 00

34:00].
Nicole Forsgren :
Number of pull requests, number of commits. And I was like, "These are all activity metrics." And so finally I pulled a few of my friends together and I was like, "Let's come up with a framework to help people think about it." And so there are five broad categories, pick three because that will help force you through the mental exercise of, "What could I possibly pick?" You don't need all five, right. This isn't... We're not playing-
Lenny :
I see.
Nicole Forsgren :
......

### Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'll add a link for that. Also, if anyone is doing some of this work now, if they have major questions that they would love to [inaudible 00

45:00] me to answer if they have success stories, if they have case studies, if they have anything that they would love to be included.
:
I remember when I wrote Accelerate before, there were a couple folks that reached out after, and they were like, "Oh, I wanted to have something included." Now I've learned. Today I've learned, right. If there's anything that folks would love to be in discussion with me about, I'm always eager to chat and nerd out about DevX and especially measurement and meas...

### On my website, I've got info.nicolefv@gmail [inaudible 00

45:40]-
Lenny :
Okay.
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah.
Lenny :
Awesome. Okay, a few more questions.
Nicole Forsgren :
Awesome. Thanks.
Lenny :
What are the most common pitfalls that companies run into when they're trying to roll out any sort of developer experience, developer productivity, system measurements, improvements?
Nicole Forsgren :
I think one I just mentioned, right. Not being clear or not understanding what it is that they're looking for because then you can have a thousand flowers bloom, and...

### So all of these things come together, and suddenly, many more companies are like, "We have to be better at this." And that was not always the case five to 10 years ago. I used to have to really explain why this was a pressing concern and why it would continue to be a oppressing concern. And now, in the last six to nine to 12 months, we have this AI moment happening, and it just poured gas on top of everything because now what's important... We've always said that [inaudible 00

49:14] execution's important, but now this is absolutely true because it's not just about what it is that you build.
:
It's about creating absolutely novel, incredibly new experiences and doing them at a speed that no one has seen before. And the only way to do this is to have this software pipeline that is fast and is safe and is stable, and is reliable. And that's where we're seeing this really interesting convergence, and pressure isn't quite the right word, but it's really forcing the discus...

### I love it. A lot of the listeners of this podcast are product managers, and this is so core to the work of a PM, so I think this is [inaudible 00

57:28]-
Nicole Forsgren :
Perfect.
Lenny :
... speaking verily directly to a lot of the listeners. Okay. So just a couple more questions. Before this podcast, I asked you a few questions, including just like what are people asking you for advice often around, and are there any other frameworks that you find really useful? And so there's a couple of things I just want to touch on, see if there's something interesting there. The first is you have this framework that you call the four-box framework...

### I love it. [inaudible 01

02:05].
Nicole Forsgren :
Now...
Lenny :
I'll check it out. It's ugly.
Nicole Forsgren :
Nice.
Lenny :
I'll Zoom in, right. Okay.
Nicole Forsgren :
Now I will say advanced mode. You can start with the same four-box framework and you can say, "What data do we have available? What do we think the relationships are?" But then you have to go back up to words and then say, "For these data points..." And we think that they represent something, and we think this is the relationship between them. "What ...

### Mm-hmm. Amazing. There's actually... I have a newsletter post, a guest post on how to do a correlation analysis and a regression analysis so folks can [inaudible 01

03:36]-
Nicole Forsgren :
Awesome. Oh, that's so great.
Lenny :
... templates and plug and play, all kinds of... makes it easy for you. So what I'm take away from this is an awesome framework, especially for thinking about a hypothesis you may have. In this case, it's like, "Customer satisfaction's going to lead to more return customers. Here's how we're going to measure it." And then you basically run the test and see if it's true. And if it's not, maybe you need to pick different metrics. Mayb...

### Wow, [inaudible 01

05:04]-
Nicole Forsgren :
What are the different things-
Lenny :
... really useful.
Nicole Forsgren :
... you should do. It is. Well, it's funny, though, because what's interesting is many times I will... I'll share it with someone, and I've got a couple that are just funny, right. But walking through the spreadsheet is often all you need to do in order to know what the decision is. And by that, I mean, so we walked through the decision. I had one where it was like, "Where should I move next, or...

### Now it's really interesting because sometimes I will only get that far when I'm working with someone I'm mentoring or coaching, and they will say, "I know what my answer is." We don't even get to the next step. But just identifying the criteria that are important is it... Now, when I was thinking about where I wanted to move next, it was proximity to an airport, the relative tech scene, the food scene. That was real high for me, a handful of things that was important. Now the next thing I do is, for each criteria, what's their relative weight, what's their importance? And I make it add up to 100%. And then I... This is the easy part, right. You just put it in a little spreadsheet, and then I give everything [inaudible 01

06:51] score, and I just multiply it out. Now this is where I'm data informed, and I'm not data driven.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
There have been times I make a decision where the whole flip a coin and whatever it's... wherever it lands on, what your reaction is tells you what it should actually be. There have been times where I multiply it out, and then I'll actually fudge the numbers to get what I want, but it's still slightly off. That's per your data informed. Same thing in business....

### I have, and this actually might be a good forcing function. Maybe [inaudible 01

08:43]-
Lenny :
Okay, awesome. So if you do it, I'll put in the show notes. It'll probably be near the bottom at the end of the episode, but that'd be awesome.
Nicole Forsgren :
Perfect.
Lenny :
Is there anything else that you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Nicole Forsgren :
No, I think that's it.
Lenny :
Well, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
Nicole Forsgren :
Absolutely.
Lenny :
All right. First ques...

### I absolutely love it. Such a good pick. Haven't read in a long time. And are they making [inaudible 01

09:48] show of that at all? That'd be something.
Nicole Forsgren :
They made a movie, and I was afraid I wasn't going to like it, so I just didn't read it. I didn't want it to ruin the book, but at least Harrison Ford was in it.
Lenny :
Okay. I'm not going to check it out. They're making a movie of Three-Body Problem. I don't know if you've read that, but that is... I'm really excited for that.
Nicole Forsgren :
It's on my list.
Lenny :
Oh, man. Best sci-fi ever. Next question actually very corr...

### I love questions that I can kind of spin around hard decisions that people have had to make and how they made them. I love hearing their thought process. And I get a little nervous when people just [inaudible 01

10:54] and shoot from the hip constantly.
Lenny :
So what is it you look for there that gives you a sense that they're someone you may want to hire or work with?
Nicole Forsgren :
I just hearing if they have some sort of process, right. If they have some kind of decision-making process, if they have criteria, if they have... How do they do evaluation?
Lenny :
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?
Nicole Forsgren :
I have a big one and a little one. My big one is pr...

**And so we'll link to this quick check. [inaudible 00**:

29:02] dora.dev/quickcheck.
Nicole Forsgren :
And by the way, they do not collect your name. They do not collect your info. There's no lead, lead gen, anything. Everything's just there. And then, there's deep dives into every single one of the capabilities.
Lenny :
Amazing. And also your book talks about all these things. So people should go check out the book. Obviously it's on Amazon. Search Accelerate. Is that right?
Nicole Forsgren :
Yep.
Lenny :
Okay. So we were talking about DORA. This may be a good time to talk about SPACE, which I think is a different framework you recommend. What is that all about?
Nicole Forsgren :
Okay, so SPACE is a way to measure, we say productivity, developer productivity, but it's a little bit more than that. SPACE is a good way to measure any type of complex creative work. Now, how do they relate? Let's say you go through the quick check. It points out four things, and you decide you want to improve continuous integration and culture, right. Well, now you're like, "Cool, but how am I going to actually measure them?" This is where SPACE comes in because SPACE helps you figure out SPACE gives you a framework to pick the right metrics.
:
Now some people are like, "Well, SPACE you didn't give me the exact metrics." People love DORA because it's like, "Here's the exact four you need." Well, SPACE is like when you want to measure something that's complex, creative work, maybe like developer productivity. There's also an example at the bottom for incident management. When you have something you want to measure, it says, "Within your context, within the metrics you have available to you, here's how to pick."
:
That's what SPACE is good for. Now we called it SPACE because it stands for the five dimensions that you want to measure. So S is satisfaction and wellbeing. So satisfaction wellbeing is kind of self-explanatory. Now, some people might jump in here and say, "Oh, well, you're just touchy-feely." This actually matters because we find that satisfaction wellbeing ends up being incredibly highly correlated with all of the other dimensions of productivity and doing things well.
:
And as soon as satisfaction and wellbeing, things like sustainability, if you're satisfied, as soon as that starts falling off, other things start to break. So this can be an incredibly strong and important signal. P is performance. This is going to be the outcome of a process. So reliability within DORA, the MTTM or change fail rate. Those are both performance metrics.
Lenny :
And so you pick one to kind of measure as performance.
Nicole Forsgren :
Yep. A is activity. Anytime you have a count or a number of something. And these we see all the time because they're super easy to instrument and automate, right. Number of pull requests, number of check-ins, number of something, that's A. C is communication and collaboration. This can be how people work and talk together. It can be meetings. It can be collaboration. It can also be how our systems communicate together. It can be the searchability of a code base. And then ease efficiency and flow. So this is going to be the flow through the system.
:
It can be the time through the system. If we think about SRE or incident management, it can be the number of hops a ticket takes until it reaches the right person. Now, to use SPACE correctly, we want to use at least three dimensions at a time because that helps us balance. Turns out DORA is actually implementation of SPACE. So DORA would be SPACE for mostly that outer loop. So again, once you've found something that you want to improve, find the metrics that make sense to you, try to have them be in balance or intention so you don't throw something out of whack, but pick three.
Lenny :
So when you say DORA is an implementation of SPACE, one has five buckets, one has four. How do you actually think about that?
Nicole Forsgren :

**So SPACE is there to help you think about how you want to pick metrics, right. So a lot of time I see people... So [inaudible 00**:

33:06] half step back. I used to advise people on how to pick metrics. For years people would pull me in to advise on DORA or Accelerate. They would ask me questions, but it ended up being metrics questions a lot. "How do I pick the right metrics to improve what I'm doing?" Like I said, they had the DORA numbers. They would pick their constraints, and they wanted to improve.
:
"But how do I improve? How do I measure this? How do I show improvement?" And so we would start thinking really critically about which metrics were the right metrics to pick. And I would always say make sure you pick balanced metrics. Make sure you pick metrics that are intention. And I could say it, but people have a hard time wrapping that around their heads because they kept picking things like number of lines of code, never picked number of lines of code.
Lenny :
Oh, wow.
Nicole Forsgren :
Number of... Still every month I get email about this.
Lenny :

**Wow, [inaudible 00**:

34:00].
Nicole Forsgren :
Number of pull requests, number of commits. And I was like, "These are all activity metrics." And so finally I pulled a few of my friends together and I was like, "Let's come up with a framework to help people think about it." And so there are five broad categories, pick three because that will help force you through the mental exercise of, "What could I possibly pick?" You don't need all five, right. This isn't... We're not playing-
Lenny :
I see.
Nicole Forsgren :
... bingo. We're not playing blackout bingo. You don't need all of them but try to have at least three across different dimensions. Now one example here. I was working with a group that wanted to improve their pull requests very generally. They just said improve pull requests. So they were thinking about pinging someone every 15 minutes, and I was like, "Oh, this is going to be bad."
:
Because we know from other literature and research like nursing, you'll get alert fatigue, where people will just start tuning out alerts. Either they'll turn them off, or they will just stop hearing them. So number of alerts, right. They're like, "Let's just think about number of alerts." And I said, "Well, but if we think about efficiency and flow, how much time do you have to work on your coding?" So those two are balanced. So we need to protect time to work as well as code review time.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
Like pull request time. And so, sometimes we can think about those, and then I think we added a satisfaction metric. Are you satisfied with the pull request process and the selection of the reviewer?
Lenny :
How do you go about actually capturing and measuring the say satisfaction?
Nicole Forsgren :
So for satisfaction, I would generally ask, right. Go ahead and ask now the ones that you instrument, you can instrument and pull out of systems all the time, right. Go ahead and grab that string. For satisfaction metric, I would only pull that periodically once every few months.
Lenny :
Like a survey to your engineering team.
Nicole Forsgren :
Like a survey. Yep, absolutely.
Lenny :
Awesome.
Nicole Forsgren :
And don't discount what people say, right. Sometimes I hear... Actually not sometimes. A lot of times, I hear people say, "Oh, but people lie." First of all, what is their incentive to lie? Why would they lie about having a bad system? Because it's bad, and they want it fixed, right. If it's absolutely a hostile work environment, they might lie and then tell you it's good. Then you have bigger problems, right. Also, do we ever see bad data from our systems or incomplete data from our systems? That's a lie, but we find ways to deal with it. We see it. We acknowledge it. We look for holes in our system data.
:
We try to deal with it, right. That's also a lie. So I think there are better ways to think about and deal with that and then try to work with it because and I wrote a paper with Mik Kersten on this several years ago on how data from people and data from systems are really important compliments because we can get certain insights from people that we'll never get from systems. Let's look at lead time from changes, for example, from commit to deploy. The speed might be fine, but people might tell you it's taking absolute heroics. It's some ridiculous Rube Goldberg machine.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
The system will never tell you that. Or you could get data on your version control system. I worked with a company several years ago, and we found out that there was a significant portion of code that was just not going into any version control system. You're never going to find that out from your systems because it's not in the systems, and it was mission-critical.
Lenny :
I can see why people come to you asking for advice on metrics because you have this framework of, "Here's the type of metrics you want." And then I think, and especially from an engineering team, there's going to be this like, "How do I optimize and make sure I'm doing the right thing and measuring the right things." For someone that wants to do this, and an hour long podcast isn't going to give them all the answers, what do you recommend they go read or go do or look at to help them figure that out?
Nicole Forsgren :

**One, I hate to be this person, but I'll point to a few of my papers. I will say I write things down because I get asked them so often, and I want to make sure it is broadly applicable or broadly available, I guess. This SPACE paper, for sure. It's an ACM, and I think the year we published, it was the most read paper at ACMQueue. Yeah. So we tried to make it as readable as possible. So the SPACE paper is nice because it outlines this framework and it gives examples of metrics in every single category. And so hopefully people can look at this and they can [inaudible 00**:

38:54], "Okay, here's an example to use here, right. Here are some of the things that I could possibly use."
:
And we're seeing that SPACE is being used lots and lots of different places. Another good one could be the paper that I mentioned with Mik Kersten, and it was about... we talked about using data from people and data from systems. We wrote it up in the DevOps context. I want to say this was written in 2016 or 2017 or something. But it helps you think through what types of data are good in which situations because you will never find yourself in a situation when you don't want both types of data. Even teams that I've worked with that are the most advanced. They have absolute instrumentation in every possible scenario.
:
In the most detailed way, they will still survey their developers at least once a year because you can get new insights, right. One book that I love. It's a little dense, but it's really interesting that I love is How to Measure Anything. And it's by Hubbard, and there are parts of it that are real stats heavy, but he has this portion in the front that's in covering intangibles. So it's like, what happens when you don't have data? You have no data. You're starting from nothing. What are good ways to hunch data? And I really love that because he covers some really good ground there.
Lenny :
Today's entire episode is brought to you by DX, a platform for measuring and improving developer productivity. DX is designed by the researchers behind frameworks such as DORA, SPACE, and DevX, including Nicole Forsgren, who is my guest for this very episode. If you've tried measuring developer productivity, you know that there are a lot of basic metrics out there and a lot of ways to do this wrong, and getting that full view of productivity is still really hard.
:
DX tackles this problem by combining qualitative and quantitative insights based on the very research Nicole and her team have done, giving you full clarity into how your developers are doing. DX is used by both startups and Fortune 500 companies, including companies like Twilio, Amplitude, eBay, Brex, Toast, Pfizer, and Procter & Gamble. To learn more about DX and get a demo of their product, visit their website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny. You also mentioned offline that you might be working on a book that will answer a lot of these questions. Is that something you're up for chatting about?
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah, absolutely. So as I mentioned, I tend to write things down when I get asked questions on it a lot. And so this is one in particular. So we'll be covering... I'm starting to go through, and I'm covering some of these, and I think some of the important topics in particular are starting with what is your problem or what is your goal and being super, super crisp on it, right. What is it that we're trying to answer? And I would say this is a bigger challenge than most people recognize or realize.
:
I'm making this set up, right. 80% of the folks that I work with, this is their biggest problem. Even at executive levels, they'll ask their team, or teams will come back with uncertainty, and they'll say like, "Well, you told me to improve developer experience." I'm like, "Okay, great. What do you mean by that?" And then teams will have gone off for several months, and they're tackling something, and they'll come back, and they'll be like, "Oh, well, wasn't what I meant."
:
And I'm like, "Okay, what do you mean by this? Are you talking about inner and outer loop? Are you talking about friction? Are you talking about culture?" Because sometimes they're talking about culture. "And if you're talking about culture, this is an incredibly valid answer. But if you're talking about culture, this is totally different than if you're talking about friction in toolchains, right. And if you're on different pages, you're heading in completely different directions."
:
So that's one thing we cover, which seems obvious, but trust me, it's not. And then even how do you... We're going to do kind of a rough version of how do you start measuring from nothing and also the measurement journey, right. How do you think about the trade-offs between and the proportion of measurement between subjective data, right, data from people. So you have Azure interviews, and you have surveys and objective data, stuff you get from systems. Because when you first start off, you'll be relying much more on data from people.
:
You can get a relatively quickly. But as you kind of transition through this measurement journey, you'll get more and more data from your systems because it's scalable. It can be engineered. You can be doing much more with it. And also, you should be thinking about, "Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good." So how do we think about this very, very strategically? How do we transition through this? How do we think about what each piece of data is for?
:
And also lots and lots of examples. So I have included example interview scripts. How do you select people? How do you screen people? Example survey scripts. What are some of the analyses we should do? And trying to make this incredibly accessible, so basically anyone can do this. So you do not need to be a data scientist, but if you have one on staff, you can hand them some of this and just let them run.
Lenny :
I think this book is going to do extremely well. Definitely come back on when it is out. I think you said maybe year-ish kind of timeframe?
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah, probably about a year by the time we get-
Lenny :
Okay.
Nicole Forsgren :
... all the way through.
Lenny :
If people want to be notified when it's out, can they sign up on your site for newsletter or anything like that? Is there any way to be in the loop as it approaches?
Nicole Forsgren :

**Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'll add a link for that. Also, if anyone is doing some of this work now, if they have major questions that they would love to [inaudible 00**:

45:00] me to answer if they have success stories, if they have case studies, if they have anything that they would love to be included.
:
I remember when I wrote Accelerate before, there were a couple folks that reached out after, and they were like, "Oh, I wanted to have something included." Now I've learned. Today I've learned, right. If there's anything that folks would love to be in discussion with me about, I'm always eager to chat and nerd out about DevX and especially measurement and measurement journeys.
Lenny :
Awesome. I usually ask this at the end, and I have more questions, but while we're here, how would people reach out to you? What's the best way to contact you?
Nicole Forsgren :

**On my website, I've got info.nicolefv@gmail [inaudible 00**:

45:40]-
Lenny :
Okay.
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah.
Lenny :
Awesome. Okay, a few more questions.
Nicole Forsgren :
Awesome. Thanks.
Lenny :
What are the most common pitfalls that companies run into when they're trying to roll out any sort of developer experience, developer productivity, system measurements, improvements?
Nicole Forsgren :
I think one I just mentioned, right. Not being clear or not understanding what it is that they're looking for because then you can have a thousand flowers bloom, and everyone's kind of running in a different direction. I think another one is not pursuing this in both a top-down and a bottom-up structure, right. And I think that can really help drive success, and having good communication throughout is super, super important, right.
:
So getting your ICs bought in and helping them understand that this is for them. We want to understand what they're doing. Knowing what vocabulary they use, what terminology they use is super important. And then chatting with leaders and understanding what their motivations are or helping them understand what the motivations could be. This kind of hearkens back to one of our earliest chats on why I even got into this and how I see two different sides to the conversation on why is DevOps even a thing? Why should we even ship faster?
:
There are so many people that I talk to that are super passionate about DevX right now, and they're like, "How can I convince my executive team this is important?" Because their developers are just completely burning out, or they use computers and anger every day. And so it's like, "How can we have the right tools to socialize this to our leaders as well?" Because this should be a priority. This needs to be a strategic piece, and how can we help pull together the right value points to communicate this and to understand what their priorities are so that we can see how this fits in, right.
Lenny :
You've been working in this space for a long time, probably longer than anyone that has ever worked on this area of developer experience productivity. What have you seen change most from the time you started working in the space to today? What kind of progress has been made?
Nicole Forsgren :
We have these increasingly large complex systems, right. So 10 or 15 years ago, the internet was around, but things were really different. Now, almost every company has a really large complex system, right. We also have a shortage of developers, or at least a reported perceived shortage of developers. More companies are technology-driven, or at least they understand they're technology driven. It's like I understand a handful... I remember a handful of years ago when I met with a financial institution whose CTO insisted to me that he was not a tech company like that. That's not real anymore. That doesn't happen anymore, at least very, very rarely.
:

**So all of these things come together, and suddenly, many more companies are like, "We have to be better at this." And that was not always the case five to 10 years ago. I used to have to really explain why this was a pressing concern and why it would continue to be a oppressing concern. And now, in the last six to nine to 12 months, we have this AI moment happening, and it just poured gas on top of everything because now what's important... We've always said that [inaudible 00**:

49:14] execution's important, but now this is absolutely true because it's not just about what it is that you build.
:
It's about creating absolutely novel, incredibly new experiences and doing them at a speed that no one has seen before. And the only way to do this is to have this software pipeline that is fast and is safe and is stable, and is reliable. And that's where we're seeing this really interesting convergence, and pressure isn't quite the right word, but it's really forcing the discussion and strategy and prioritization, right.
Lenny :
I'm glad you touched on AI. That was actually exactly where I was going to go next.
Nicole Forsgren :
Perfect.
Lenny :
Yeah, obviously productivity, AI, engineering, something that's top of mind for a lot of people. There's a lot of layoffs that have been happening. There's a lot of talk of we don't need as many engineers. I actually had dinner not too long ago with few, I'd say 10 X engineers, and those are folks that people sometimes say they don't need Copilot. They're not going to use any of these tools. They're already amazing. And they were the opposite.
:
They're like, "This is making me 100% more effective and efficient and I love it." So clearly good things are happening there. I don't know what the question is specifically, but I guess have you seen the impact of AI on engineering productivity? And has that shifted how you think about developer experience and productivity beyond what you already just shared?
Nicole Forsgren :
Absolutely. So yes and, right.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
I think this is a super interesting open question. So can I answer it just with a whole bunch of questions?
Lenny :
Absolutely.
Nicole Forsgren :
We're absolutely seeing an impact, and we continue to explore this. So I have an interesting question to see how it'll change the SPACE framework. What's open here? I think a few things will remain, right? Satisfaction's still going to be there, performance is still going to be there, activity's still going to be there. How you communicate with people and with the tool efficiency and flow is still going to be there. I believe it will change and add a dimension like trust or reliability. How do I rely? Can I rely on it?
:
Will I have an over-reliance on it? And what we're seeing is that, probably unsurprisingly, people really fundamentally shift the way they work when they work with an AI-enabled tool like GitHub, Copilot, or Tabnine or others because now, instead of just writing code or having a short auto-complete, you spend more time reviewing code than writing code, right. There's this wonderful paper out that uses the Cups model. I'll share it with you. A team at MSR did it. Defines it, "About 50% of your time now is spent reviewing versus writing." But it'll be interesting to see how that changes things longitudinally, right.
:
Because other... Some of my colleagues also did a paper that showed that you can do certain tasks, like build an HTTP server 50% faster, but I don't think that's what productivity's about when you're using an AI tool, frankly. Anyone who's looking at that and dear CEOs or whoever who are like, "Now I can lay off half my workforce." That's not what this is about, right. It's not about taking a task and cutting your time in half because now what we've enabled is your ability to do certain things faster and then free up some of your cognitive space so that you can do harder things with this new co-pilot sidecar or something, right.
:
But also, because now you're accepting text and then reviewing it, we've changed what your mental model is. So we've changed the friction model that you expect. We've changed the cognitive load of what you expect. We're changing reliance on code. So what does this mean for reliance or overreliance? What does this mean for learning? What does this mean for novices versus experts? How do we measure productivity, right? There are a handful of us that are having these discussions on what does this mean and how do we communicate it thoughtfully?
:
Again, we really need to have these kind of holistic, balanced metrics because if it's an oversimplification, we really risk losing the forest for the trees, right. But it's also super interesting and super compelling, I think. How can we think about learning or onboarding to new code bases or new languages for folks who already know computational learning? I think it's also very different for folks who are just learning programming languages and don't already know things like computational thinking.
Lenny :
If someone was excited to kind of go down this road of, "We're going to focus on developer experience. We're going to focus on helping our engineers be more productive," what are the next step or two that they should take in your opinion just broadly knowing that you don't know any specifics about, say, the company that's thinking about this right now?
Nicole Forsgren :
I think if you're walking away from this podcast and you're like, "I'm already working on this, or I think this is a thing that's happening," I would say just go check your work basically, right. Has this been written down? Is there a clearly defined challenge, problem, something? Start there.
:
Absolutely because that is going to be the thing that reduces confusion the best, right. Absolutely. And then see if there's any data. And data can be very loosely defined, right. Is there any signal that is related to the problem? I'd start there. And you can do that. You can do that in a week. You can hunt something down.
Lenny :
Sounds like something you could do in a day.
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah. Well, depending. Depending on how scattered things are.
Lenny :
Are there any companies that you look at as good models of, "They do this really well."
Nicole Forsgren :
I think Google does this incredibly well, and sometimes I hesitate to mention Google because they're like... some people are like, "Well, we can't be Google, and we aren't really advanced." But the thing I love about Google's approach is that they've really taken kind of this measurement phase approach to things, even when they roll it out in new places. They're very systematic in how they measure things.
:
They have incredible telemetry and tooling and instrumentation, and they continue to invest time in developer experience surveys and they triangulate them. And one thing that I also love being able to point out here is if there is ever a disagreement between the surveys and the instrumentation, which is incredibly advanced, almost every time, every that I've ever heard of the surveys are correct and not the instrumentation.
Lenny :
Amazing. I have just a couple more questions unrelated to this topic. Is there anything else that you thought you think would be useful to share or leave people with around this general space?
Nicole Forsgren :
I would say that thinking about what it is you want to do is always important, right. Like getting crisp, the ability to communicate clearly is always one of the best things. I think one of my superpowers and one of the things that I've been working with my teams on doing and kind of teaching them is, and one of the things that's really leveled up our work in general, is making your work incredibly accessible.
:
And accessible, not necessarily in the accessibility definition of the word, but making it very easy to understand what you're doing for your key audiences. And so thinking about doing that for anything that... anyone who's listening for all of your work is super important, right. So who is it that your audience is? What's their role? What words resonate with them? And then always being able to translate your work into a few sentences or a paragraph or left... or less.
Lenny :

**I love it. A lot of the listeners of this podcast are product managers, and this is so core to the work of a PM, so I think this is [inaudible 00**:

57:28]-
Nicole Forsgren :
Perfect.
Lenny :
... speaking verily directly to a lot of the listeners. Okay. So just a couple more questions. Before this podcast, I asked you a few questions, including just like what are people asking you for advice often around, and are there any other frameworks that you find really useful? And so there's a couple of things I just want to touch on, see if there's something interesting there. The first is you have this framework that you call the four-box framework. I'm curious what that is and what it's all about.
Nicole Forsgren :
Yes. I love this four-box framework. I've used it for years. I actually pulled it out first when I was a professor, and I still to this day get LinkedIn messages from my students saying that it's like the most useful thing they've ever used. So here's what it is. I literally pull this out on napkins, at bars, at conferences to this day.
:
So here we go. Draw four boxes on a piece of paper, two on the top, two on the bottom. So they'll be kind of aligned. The first two to the left of them write the word words. And below them, write the word data and then between the two on the top, draw an arrow between them. So it'll say words, box, arrow, box, right. Is that making sense?
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
And then on the bottom it'll say data, box, arrow, box.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
Okay. So on the top half, this is where, if you want to think about measuring something or testing something, you have to start with words. So as an example, let's just say, I think that customer satisfaction gets us more money or customer satisfaction gets us return customers. Let's do customer satisfaction. So the first box, you'll put customer satisfaction inside the box, and you'll put return customers in the second box. Now always start with words. You do not start with data. You always start with words.
:
And then you'll go around to a couple of people, stakeholders, managers, others, and you'll say, "Do you agree with this? Is this actually what we're doing?" And it can turn into a sentence. And then, in the boxes below it, this is your data. How are we going to measure customer satisfaction? It could be a survey.
:
And so this is where you'll go, and you'll say, "What data points do we have that could proxy for? What could be our data points for customer satisfaction?" And this is where it gets tricky. You could say, "Well, customer satisfaction could be return customers. But we think it leads to return customers, so we can't use that here." But return customers could be... So that's where you kind of roll this out. So how else would we measure customer satisfaction? I made this hard on myself.
Lenny :
Like a CSAT score or NPS score.
Nicole Forsgren :
CSAT. Yeah.
Lenny :
Yeah.
Nicole Forsgren :
CSAT, NPS.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
We could say the amount of money that they spent. It's a stretch.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
Okay. Now, return customers. Let's go to the next box. How are we going to measure return customers? Depending on our context, let's say that this is an online business. We could say that it's return customers as measured through the website. We could say that it's returned customers. We could just ask them, right. Maybe we have a follow-up survey. Return customers. Maybe we're going to do a stretch here. Maybe we say it's a referral link. This helps us get super clear on what it is we're going to measure. Now, the reason I like this is because if some of our... Now this data analysis. We'll just do correlations here, right.
:
If we have longitudinal overtime, that's fine. You can hand this to a data scientist. You can hand this to someone and you can say, "What data do we have? Let's go run this." If something here falls apart, now you can point to the data boxes, and we can get mad about the things in the data boxes, and we can say, "What's wrong? Is the data poor quality? Are we missing data? Was this a bad proxy?" Proxy stands in for something else. "Was this ridiculous?" One of the things I made up. It was just a bad idea.
:
Instead of getting mad at Lenny for his really stupid idea or getting mad at Nicole because this was a really bad idea, we can say, "This was problematic. What's wrong here?" Or we can go back up to the words at the top, and we can say, "This is not actually something that is probably going to hold, or this is not something we want to test right now, or this is something instead..." And it makes things incredibly clear. It helps you communicate what it is you want to do fairly quickly.
Lenny :

**I love it. [inaudible 01**:

02:05].
Nicole Forsgren :
Now...
Lenny :
I'll check it out. It's ugly.
Nicole Forsgren :
Nice.
Lenny :
I'll Zoom in, right. Okay.
Nicole Forsgren :
Now I will say advanced mode. You can start with the same four-box framework and you can say, "What data do we have available? What do we think the relationships are?" But then you have to go back up to words and then say, "For these data points..." And we think that they represent something, and we think this is the relationship between them. "What do they represent? If I turn this into a sentence, what do they represent?"
:
And then you want to double check because spurious correlation's one of my favorite websites instead of charts. So you'll want to go chat with someone, interview, make sure things are actually right. But the challenge is I will see people run every correlation they could think of, but they haven't turned it into a word or a sentence that you can communicate to someone else.
:
They don't do the check, and they don't do that before... one, before running the correlations. And two, if it's there, right. All of our data is so interrelated that we quite often will find spurious correlations. But it can be really helpful just to have that laid out, even if it's just on a post-it, to say, "What are the things I expect to see? What is this actually testing? What relationship do I suspect is there?"
Lenny :

**Mm-hmm. Amazing. There's actually... I have a newsletter post, a guest post on how to do a correlation analysis and a regression analysis so folks can [inaudible 01**:

03:36]-
Nicole Forsgren :
Awesome. Oh, that's so great.
Lenny :
... templates and plug and play, all kinds of... makes it easy for you. So what I'm take away from this is an awesome framework, especially for thinking about a hypothesis you may have. In this case, it's like, "Customer satisfaction's going to lead to more return customers. Here's how we're going to measure it." And then you basically run the test and see if it's true. And if it's not, maybe you need to pick different metrics. Maybe you need to pick a different conclusion.
Nicole Forsgren :
And within the DORA framework, we would say, "If we want to improve our speed and stability, we think improving build time would help. And then how would I measure build time?" These are the-
Lenny :
Makes them circle back.
Nicole Forsgren :
... data points that I have available to us. Yep, to circle back.
Lenny :
I love it. It's all connected. Okay. And then, last question. I asked you what advice people often ask you for, and you said that it's around making decisions. And I'm curious, what advice do you give people about making decisions?
Nicole Forsgren :
Yes. So this one comes up in business but also comes up personally and among my mentees. So many times, it starts with being very crisp about your objectives and definitions, but then it comes down to really clearly defining what your criteria is. What's important, and then among that criteria what's most important. Some of my friends know I have a decision-making spreadsheet that I have shared out with a handful of friends on should you take a job? Where should you move?
Lenny :

**Wow, [inaudible 01**:

05:04]-
Nicole Forsgren :
What are the different things-
Lenny :
... really useful.
Nicole Forsgren :
... you should do. It is. Well, it's funny, though, because what's interesting is many times I will... I'll share it with someone, and I've got a couple that are just funny, right. But walking through the spreadsheet is often all you need to do in order to know what the decision is. And by that, I mean, so we walked through the decision. I had one where it was like, "Where should I move next, or what job should I take?" So when I started DORA, I did this. Starting DORA, I thought, was my lowest. Once I walked through the spreadsheet, it became my high. So what you do is you outline of all of your options. What do you want to do? And then you say, "What are the criteria that are important to me?" So if it's for a job, is it something like total comp, cash money, prestige, team, job predictability, work-life balance. Identify the criteria that are most important to you.
:

**Now it's really interesting because sometimes I will only get that far when I'm working with someone I'm mentoring or coaching, and they will say, "I know what my answer is." We don't even get to the next step. But just identifying the criteria that are important is it... Now, when I was thinking about where I wanted to move next, it was proximity to an airport, the relative tech scene, the food scene. That was real high for me, a handful of things that was important. Now the next thing I do is, for each criteria, what's their relative weight, what's their importance? And I make it add up to 100%. And then I... This is the easy part, right. You just put it in a little spreadsheet, and then I give everything [inaudible 01**:

06:51] score, and I just multiply it out. Now this is where I'm data informed, and I'm not data driven.
Lenny :
Mm-hmm.
Nicole Forsgren :
There have been times I make a decision where the whole flip a coin and whatever it's... wherever it lands on, what your reaction is tells you what it should actually be. There have been times where I multiply it out, and then I'll actually fudge the numbers to get what I want, but it's still slightly off. That's per your data informed. Same thing in business. There are many times where you actually run the numbers, and it'll give you a class or a category of things, and then you choose. Now this is where one of my favorite quotes I heard somewhere about strategy comes into play and that's that, "The key to having a good strategy is knowing what not to do."
:
And the key to executing a good strategy is actually not doing it. So you can have many options, right. As a leader and as an executive, we have many options, and we only fund some of them. If you fund everything, things are going to fail. So being able to think through and identify what your criteria are, identifying that criteria, what's your selection criteria, what's your evaluative criteria, ranking them, and then deciding what the cutoff is is important. You can't fund everything. You don't get to pick everything.
Lenny :
Amazing. I love the spreadsheet idea. I've made versions of it, but it's always... I think, like you said, a lot of times, the exercise is just tell you what you already think and just gives you like-
Nicole Forsgren :
Yep.
Lenny :
"... All right, you're right. You probably should just do that thing you already thought you should do."
Nicole Forsgren :
Yep.
Lenny :
Have you thought about making a public template of this spreadsheet? Even though it is simple, I bet it would be really helpful to people.
Nicole Forsgren :

**I have, and this actually might be a good forcing function. Maybe [inaudible 01**:

08:43]-
Lenny :
Okay, awesome. So if you do it, I'll put in the show notes. It'll probably be near the bottom at the end of the episode, but that'd be awesome.
Nicole Forsgren :
Perfect.
Lenny :
Is there anything else that you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Nicole Forsgren :
No, I think that's it.
Lenny :
Well, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
Nicole Forsgren :
Absolutely.
Lenny :
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Nicole Forsgren :
We actually had the perfect segue because the book I've recommended absolutely the most is called Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt. Another one is Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Abbott... Dave Evans. And the last one is probably Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card. No comment right now on some of his political commentary, but I used to have extra copies in my office when I was a professor and I would just hand it out to my students. It's a fun, just easy nonsense read, but...
Lenny :

**I absolutely love it. Such a good pick. Haven't read in a long time. And are they making [inaudible 01**:

09:48] show of that at all? That'd be something.
Nicole Forsgren :
They made a movie, and I was afraid I wasn't going to like it, so I just didn't read it. I didn't want it to ruin the book, but at least Harrison Ford was in it.
Lenny :
Okay. I'm not going to check it out. They're making a movie of Three-Body Problem. I don't know if you've read that, but that is... I'm really excited for that.
Nicole Forsgren :
It's on my list.
Lenny :
Oh, man. Best sci-fi ever. Next question actually very correlated. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?
Nicole Forsgren :
I think going through some real just easy, fun watches lately. I'm rewatching Suits again, but Ted Lasso is a favorite, and I just tore through Never Have I Ever, which is fun because John McEnroe narrates it, which is hilarious.
Lenny :
John McEnroe, the tennis player?
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah. It's a riot. Yeah, it's so funny.
Lenny :
I love it. Next question, what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?
Nicole Forsgren :

**I love questions that I can kind of spin around hard decisions that people have had to make and how they made them. I love hearing their thought process. And I get a little nervous when people just [inaudible 01**:

10:54] and shoot from the hip constantly.
Lenny :
So what is it you look for there that gives you a sense that they're someone you may want to hire or work with?
Nicole Forsgren :
I just hearing if they have some sort of process, right. If they have some kind of decision-making process, if they have criteria, if they have... How do they do evaluation?
Lenny :
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?
Nicole Forsgren :
I have a big one and a little one. My big one is probably Sleep Eight. So I live in Arizona. It gets hot here sometimes.
Lenny :
Oh, Eight Sleep.
Nicole Forsgren :
Or yeah, Eight Sleep. Yeah, the other way around.
Lenny :
Yeah.
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah, so one's fun because it-
Lenny :
Cool.
Nicole Forsgren :
... it makes the bed cold and also gives me some data, which is probably a little bit off, but in the approximation's fun. And then Korean face masks. They're just fun. Yeah. And you can get some pretty good ones for just a couple dollars, and that's always fun. Self-care.
Lenny :
Wow. First mention of that one, of Korean face masks.
Nicole Forsgren :
Right. Listen, everyone get on board.
Lenny :
I just did the TikTok. There's a filter now where you could see how you look when you age, and I'm not happy with how it turned out. And so I might look into this.
Nicole Forsgren :
I had some basal cell cancer on my forehead a few years ago, and so I am much more careful with my skin, and you can get... One of my favorites is COSRX. You can get 10 for like $15. So it's fun to just chill at the end of the day with a good face mask.
Lenny :
I was going to ask you for a specific pick, and so we got one.
Nicole Forsgren :
Yep.
Lenny :
Amazing. This next question I ask everyone, and it's especially appropriate to you, but I don't know if you'll have an answer. What's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute? And I feel like you have a big perspective on this, so I'm curious what you have as an answer.
Nicole Forsgren :
I think I alluded to this earlier. I would say that it's helping everyone. So I've done this before, but I think it's helping everyone to ask who's our audience and how will we share this now. And it's sort of interesting because, right now, I'm wearing two hats. One is at MSR, Microsoft Research. We lead very ambitious research, right. So like H2, H3.
Lenny :
I mean, what is H3? The third half?
Nicole Forsgren :
Oh, Horizon 3. And so it's-
Lenny :
Oh, Horizon 3. Oh, okay.
Nicole Forsgren :
... supposed to be five to 10 years out, which-
Lenny :
Got it.
Nicole Forsgren :

**... right now is like, who even knows, right? [inaudible 01**:

13:14]-
Lenny :

**And we're going to be in computers, living [inaudible 01**:

13:16]-
Nicole Forsgren :
Yeah. AI has completely upended how we kind of think of Horizons. And so when we're thinking really ambitiously and very, very, very forward-looking, what's our check-in? How do we evaluate this? And then how can we easily communicate it to our core audience? And so here, who's our audience, and how do we bring the far near?
:
And then for the other hat I'm wearing, I'm working with OCTO kind of across all of Microsoft to take a data-informed approach to really improve and uplevel our central developer infrastructure. And so, as we're thinking very, very tactically, what is our long-term vision, and how do we align with several of our broad stakeholders? And so there it's who's our audience, and how do we bring the near, far?
Lenny :
I love that. Final question. What is one tactical piece of advice that listeners can do this week to help improve their developer productivity or developer experience and move it in the right direction?
Nicole Forsgren :
If you walk away from this podcast right now, you could take a look at what's happening in your org today. Is it written down? Is it clear? Do you have any existing data and efforts? And if not, go find a handful of developers and ask them how they feel about their work tools and their work process and what the biggest barriers to their productivity are.
Lenny :
Also, pick up a copy of Accelerate on Amazon or your local retail establishment. Nicole, this was amazing. I think we're going to help a lot of companies move faster, have better and happier engineers, which is going to create infinite value in the world. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Nicole Forsgren :
I am on Twitter and Bluesky, Nicolefv. And my website is nicolefv.com, and my... all my contact information is there. And as we mentioned previously, I'm working on a new project and a new book digging into exactly these ideas, right. How can we measure better? How can we improve? And what does that measurement process look like?
:
Both for kind of one time, really quick unofficial measurement pieces, and if we want to do kind of very formal longer term measurement pieces. So if anyone is interested in that or has any success stories they'd love to share, I would love to hear more about it. So please reach out and share. I'd love to hear more.
Lenny :
Awesome. Nicole, thank you again for being here.
Nicole Forsgren :
Okay, thank you Lenny.
