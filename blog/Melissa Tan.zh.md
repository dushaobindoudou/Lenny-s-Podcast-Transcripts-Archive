## ## 核心要点 | Key Takeaways

### Yeah. And so that's quite a lot of impact. And being a finance team, they said logically we should just double the team. If each person brings in more than a million, if we want to double the AR, let's just double the team. And so I actually pushed back significantly though. I thought to myself, "If we double the team, what is everyone on the team going to own and drive? Is it like we split up different parts of the website, different parts of the product 1

00 PM owns just like the checkout flow.
:
I didn't think that was going to be interesting enough for the team and going to help us recruit people that were excited to solve such small parts of the growth problem. And so really thinking about how do you carve out scope and if you are a growth team, maybe thinking about splitting up by problems to solve that are really meaty by areas of the funnel like activation, monetization, et cetera. So first starting out with carving out good scope. And then...

### One of the most common pitfalls I'd say is not having, and I've alluded to this, not having a sense of the big picture from the start and not being strategic about what your go-to market strategy is going to be. Also, what is your pricing and packaging going to look like? So I wrote actually an article for the YC blog a few years ago with Abby [inaudible 00

50:48] who was on my team at Dropbox about this because I felt like even at Dropbox, I mean it's a great thing. We were haphazardly finding amazing things. We had a freemium consumer product. Then we realized people wanted a Teams product, so we built a Teams product, but we never created that whole blueprint of what should it look like and what are the different connection points across consumer business? What should our model look like? I've also seen companies that maybe weren't intentional e...

### I think that's it. I wanted to make sure, I know I talked a lot about developing people, so thank all the people that have helped develop me in my career and then especially thank all the folks that I've worked with and my team, especially the team at Webflow and particularly wanted to make sure to thank [Xing Lin 01

10:14], Rory Davidson and [Jo Wang01:10:16] who joined me from previous companies to Webflow.
Lenny :
Shoutouts. Well, with that, Melissa, we have reached our very exciting lightning ground. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
Melissa Tan :
Yes.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Melissa Tan :
The first one is Leaders Eat Last. I really like that leadership book by Simon Sinek. Also two non-career related books is The Untethered Soul. It ...

### That's good. Even better [inaudible 01

13:01].
Melissa Tan :
Yeah, yeah. So one is thing that I've often heard from folks is it's hard to learn Webflow. And so basically watching our university videos, which is where we teach Webflow while also building the designer, and we actually now enable to have the videos in the product, so you can do them side by side. And then the other one is our Figma to Webflow plugin, which is you can take a Figma design and then convert it to Webflow, which is a great hack if you already have a design i...

**Yeah. And so that's quite a lot of impact. And being a finance team, they said logically we should just double the team. If each person brings in more than a million, if we want to double the AR, let's just double the team. And so I actually pushed back significantly though. I thought to myself, "If we double the team, what is everyone on the team going to own and drive? Is it like we split up different parts of the website, different parts of the product 1**:

00 PM owns just like the checkout flow.
:
I didn't think that was going to be interesting enough for the team and going to help us recruit people that were excited to solve such small parts of the growth problem. And so really thinking about how do you carve out scope and if you are a growth team, maybe thinking about splitting up by problems to solve that are really meaty by areas of the funnel like activation, monetization, et cetera. So first starting out with carving out good scope. And then the second thing is just infusing a culture of thinking like an owner. This infusing of the culture, I think it comes out in a few ways. One is, and this is really common in growth. Growth is so cross-functional that you often will end up feeling like you're blocked by other teams.
:
Let's say we want to run an experiment on this part of the product, maybe it's a core PM that kind of owns that service area that doesn't want to drive that thing or let's say or blocked by a bottleneck on designer engineering. It's something where I think if you're thinking an owner, you are not feeling easily disempowered because you can't do something and instead you're thinking, "What is everything I can do and did I exhaust all the options?"
:
And then finally it's leading by example. I try to also show to my team that I'm always thinking like an owner and then I'm always trying to do everything I can. And finally as a leader, thinking like an owner also means taking responsibility for your team. And so if things don't go right in my team, I'm the first one to say that ultimately I'm responsible and it's a failure or oversight on my side. And so that is what I think an ownership mentality is. It's just really thinking about the scope, creating that culture and then as a leader it's just seeing yourself as ultimately being accountable.
Lenny :
Awesome. And this connects to something else I wanted to pull the thread on, which is the team first bucket. I think about Meta, not to throw them under the bus or anything, but I feel like everyone I know at Meta their performance review is very tied to their impact. It's very impact driven and that leads to people needing to drive impact themselves. I drove this impact and they look at how much did you contribute to that impact versus other people on your team. And it creates some challenges I think for people. How do you create that feeling of team first, even though your performance as you talked about is so tied to here's your success metric, here's what success means for you, for the team, how do you make it feel team first versus like, I need to do this myself?
Melissa Tan :

**There's definitely a delicate balance here. It comes down to the way that I think the manager leads the team and sets the tone. And so for me, I always make it clear that even though results are important, it's a team sport. And so I often find that I am encouraging the team to work together. So again, as a leader, you have context in everything happening. So sometimes I know 1**:

00 PM is working on something or even a PM outside our team is working on something and I try to actually fill in context if I think someone on my team could contribute. And I encourage that action even though it doesn't maybe feed into impact on the thing they're driving. So it really comes down to the culture that you set and what you encourage the team to do. I also think the more that you can see that you actually benefit from helping each other out, the better it is.
:
And finally, I think again, leading by example, because I actually am very team first, I'm often actually helping other teams and doing things that might not ultimately benefit or be part of my scope. A good example here is I was actually driving pricing and packaging at Webflow for a very long time just because no one at the company was driving it and it was a huge opportunity area and I actually was doing it for enterprise pricing too. And so even though I am overseeing self-serve, I was actually supporting enterprise pricing and packaging. And so I also showed to my team, "Hey, I'm also doing all these things to help the company." And I think that is what helps set that tone and that culture.
Lenny :
How do you then avoid doing too much work? I think there's also this challenge of people being too good at too many things and then they end up doing so many things and then they burn out. Do you have any rules of thumb or lessons there?
Melissa Tan :
I think for me it's been a learning journey too. I've actually gotten feedback on that very thing for my team that Melissa sometimes taking on too much or trying to do too much. And so I think it's a delicate balance. If we're talking about that person individually, you have to know what your limits are and you also can do things in spurts, but it's important to know ultimately what you can take on. Also I find that putting a specific timeline like, "Hey, I'm going to do this thing for a quarter, but after that we really need to find somebody else to do it." Or hand it off is really helpful. It's definitely a delicate balance. I do think it's a great question because I think that's a common thing people early in their careers struggle with, which is they could lose focus because they're trying to help everybody.
:
That was actually a problem I had when I first joined Dropbox is I was the only sales ops person, so I was just helping every sales leader with their metrics and very focused. And so it is a little bit of trial and error. I think the most important thing is to not be so overly focused on just what you're doing and try to help others, but then knowing that there are certain things that just can't drop. And if you start to see things that are starting to drop that you're ultimately responsible for, that's a signal that you're taking on too much.
Lenny :
This episode is brought to you by Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.
:
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage, Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.
:
Let's come back to the developing talent bucket. I would kind of went on a tangent, but I want to come back to that. So we talked about why you're excited about developing talent, the benefits you've experienced. I'm curious what you actually do to help people become better product managers, leaders of all kinds. What actually have you seen works?
Melissa Tan :
In terms of developing talent, I think of this as stages of the life cycle of your relationship, right? So I think at first actually starts is a very meta as a growth person starts with when you hire somebody, really making sure you're finding somebody that is a good fit for the role. It's a good mutual fit. I also tend to look for folks that have a growth mindset.
:
There're people that are wanting to learn. They're looking for feedback. They take feedback well. And then after that they join the company, and as a manager, my job is to help set them up for success. So how do I ramp them up as quickly as possible, connect them to the right people, the company? How do I also make sure it's clear what success looks like in their first 90 days? And then how do I help them secure early wins essentially?
:
So I often will suggest, "Hey, you should do this presentation. It's a great way to get visibility early in your journey here." Here are some things where there's low hanging fruit or even rotting fruit that you should take on into secure early wins. Then in your journey, I think it's a lot about just giving feedback along the way, making sure you give visibility. One recent hack I have is having folks on the team create looms that they can share with different leaders at Webflow. It's hard to sometimes get visibility and get live meeting calendars, but if you create a five or 10 minute-loom on something you did. That's just a great way to get visibility.
:
And then finally, I think it's that lifelong relationship actually. So I'm still in touch with a lot of people that I've managed and I've helped them. Whether it's looking for their new job or they have career advice, I always make myself available. And so it's actually that lifelong journey of just developing that person. And at some point it's not even developing that person, but it's having a friendship with somebody. And I feel like I've learned a ton from people that I have managed. And so it ends up being this really great thing where you initially started working together but you now know each other so well. And I think that's even how I've developed as a manager is just getting feedback from my team.
Lenny :
This all comes back to something you mentioned a couple of times earlier, just caring a lot about the person that you work with. Your approach also reminds me of this book, Radical Candor. I imagine you're a fan and that's kind of the way you think about it.
Melissa Tan :
Yeah, definitely. Interestingly enough, Kim Scott was at Dropbox for a short period of time, so when I joined Dropbox, she was actually on my interview panel and we overlapped for three months and she actually workshopped that book with our team before she published it. And that always resonated with me. And I remember her saying you have to ... I forget the exact words, but it's essentially be direct but deeply care.
Lenny :
Yeah. Care deeply, but something directly challenged directly. Something like that.
Melissa Tan :
Yeah, care deeply but challenge directly and that has always been something that is something I try to infuse and has really inspired me as leader.
Lenny :
Awesome. We're going to link to that book if folks don't know about it. I love it. You talked about hiring PMs and how that is important in building high performing teams. So let's spend a little time there, maybe just two questions all throughout and you can approach them however you want. One is just what do you look for when you're hiring product managers? You've hired a lot of PMs. You've managed a lot of PMs over the years. What do you look for, especially things that maybe other people don't focus on enough, and then just what is your interview process? What do you find is most helpful for interviewing process-wise?
Melissa Tan :
In terms of what I look for, I think there's this kind of known list of things that you probably want to look for, for a PM that I probably are not going to ... I'm say anything groundbreaking here, but obviously communication skills, the ability to manage stakeholders and work well cross-functionally. The things that I lean especially heavy on in my interview process is this concept of first principles thinking or strong critical thinking. So usually there's some live problem solving component to my interview process where I really lean more heavily into how would you approach X problem? And then I dig into the Y and try to understand why would they approach it this way, see what questions they're asking and just see how they approach problem solving.
:
And then the other thing that I look for that I mentioned is that growth mindset. So really seeing how does this person take feedback. And so I'll actually sometimes give feedback to candidates through the process. Something that I do that I learned a few years ago that was super helpful, so I always have a presentation component to the interview process that checks for prepared thinking communication. And I recommend a prep call between the two of us before that presentation. And I actually will give feedback on the presentation.
:
And what this gives me signal is what is it actually going to be like to work together? And then I see how they incorporate it into the final product and that is always really interesting and sometimes it's the biggest signal to what it's going to be like to work with this person.
Lenny :
Okay, this is great. I want to spend a little time here. So what is the actual sequence that you recommend or you use for interviewing? There's a presentation, there's a rep call but also is kind of involved in that.
Melissa Tan :
Usually hiring manager screen, and I actually do the live problem solving at this screen. I actually think it weeds out the most people. And there's actually two things I do here. One is a live problem solving. How would you approach X? So let's say I'm hiring for pricing at Webflow, I would ask, "How would you approach pricing?" I sometimes would say, "Hey, do you have your laptop? Can you pull up our pricing page? Curious to get your thoughts, what would you want to change?" That was a trick I learned at Dropbox where we would actually pull up the Dropbox website and be like, "Hey, what'd you want to test here? Why?" And you get a ton of signal on how they approach the problem, how they think.
:
I ask why a bunch. And then the next screen is talking to more folks at the team that test for different competencies. And depending on what you're hiring for, we just have each person focused on a different competency. And it also depends on the roles. So some roles are more technical, some require working more closely with different stakeholders, so you want to make sure you can test those things. And then the final round is the presentation and then also maybe a conversation on other areas.
:
We want that kind of come through the interview process. We want to dig in further. The presentation is usually thinking through how you'd approach, your collecting all this information on the company or the problem throughout the interview process. And so it culminates in what do you think this should look like or maybe what would you want to do in your first 90 days? It depends on the role, but it's usually some type of presentation about the problem you would be working on at the company.
:
Before that, we have that preparation call with me where often candidates will have questions like, "Oh, I need to know this data," or "I'm curious about X." And so it's really just a call to help them. And then at this stage too, they'll often have the actual draft of the presentation and so we'll go through it together and I'll actually be like, "Hey, I think you should lean in heavier here. How would you think about this?" I'll even say for example, at Webflow I'll be like, "We're thinking about X, Y, Z thing just so you know. And maybe incorporating that into your presentation would be really helpful.
:
And so that's where I get a lot of signal of what is it going to be like to work with this person on a presentation? And then I'll see in the presentation whether they incorporate it or not or how they did. And sometimes I've seen candidates that didn't incorporate any of it and I kind of am like, "Okay, this is probably not a fit." And actually I think that other thing about that call is it helps just set the candidate up for success. It's actually quite a lot of work to create a presentation. The more we can help them by giving them information, making sure they can be successful, it's helpful. And I think guess lastly, it gives them a taste of what it's like to work with me.
Lenny :
I've never heard of that step before. That is really interesting. They actually give them feedback before they present. I imagine they're like, "What the hell is going on here?" I thought I was trying to show them what I can do, not like they're going to help me do a great job. That is really interesting. Maybe two very logistical questions there. How much time do you give them to work on this presentation? And then two, you said that you asked some questions related to the actual problem solving versus a theoretical problem. So those are the two questions, I guess.
Melissa Tan :
Typically we will schedule it about a week in advance. They have a week. The tricky thing here is obviously it's a big ask to ask someone to create a presentation. And so if it's one week that's long enough to create it, but it's short enough that you don't spend tons of time. The other thing is just making it clear, don't exceed more than X number of slides. In Webflow's case we've done, don't exceed more than 30 slides. And that's like quite a lot. We do not expect you to do 30 slides. And then the other thing I make sure to emphasize is it's really about wanting to know how you'd approach it. So don't worry about the slides, be able to talk to it and have what you need to talk to it because we're actually just looking for the substance. And so that's how much time we give them and it's usually a 30-minute presentation with 15-minute Q&A.
:
The second part of your question was, so in terms of picking the topic, so there's a few ways to think about it. I know some folks will be like, "Oh, we have candidates present on something they've worked with in the past." I've tried that form and it's really difficult because I found that candidates even sometimes spend tons of time sharing the context of that company. And then also it doesn't really give a sense of, because as you're interviewing from a role, you're getting a ton of context on the actual company and the problem. And so it also is testing for how much did they pick up along the way. Also, would they like working on this area once they join? So there are some candidates that sometimes are concerned about the amount of time they would spend on it or say, "This is going to be a big lift."
:
And definitely mindful of that. I think the main thing though is it is actually in the candidate's best interest to kind of understand what they're going to work on and start to understand,
Melissa Tan :
For example, there are some candidates that have gone through the far through process and haven't worked in the Webflow product very much. And I always think that's an interesting flag because if you aren't in the product a lot, you're not going to get good context on whether you like it or not. And so I actually think it's almost even in the best interest of the candidate to go much deeper.
Lenny :
I could spend another hour talking about interview strategy, but I want to make sure we have time for the growth team stuff. So let's transition to that. And my first question here is you've worked with a lot of different teams, a lot of different companies on helping them figure out their growth strategy, hiring their growth teams, just kind of figuring out growth. I'm curious what the most common pitfalls and mistakes you've seen across companies trying to figure out growth and build growth teams.
Melissa Tan :

**One of the most common pitfalls I'd say is not having, and I've alluded to this, not having a sense of the big picture from the start and not being strategic about what your go-to market strategy is going to be. Also, what is your pricing and packaging going to look like? So I wrote actually an article for the YC blog a few years ago with Abby [inaudible 00**:

50:48] who was on my team at Dropbox about this because I felt like even at Dropbox, I mean it's a great thing. We were haphazardly finding amazing things. We had a freemium consumer product. Then we realized people wanted a Teams product, so we built a Teams product, but we never created that whole blueprint of what should it look like and what are the different connection points across consumer business? What should our model look like? I've also seen companies that maybe weren't intentional enough about pricing from the start, and so thinking about what is the value metric?
:
And then they've already have massive scale and then they're rethinking their pricing. That's actually quite a big headache to actually think about, okay, how do we grandfather users? How do we bring the legacy customers onto our new pricing? And so thinking about your pricing from the start is important thing might go to market from the start is important. The other thing I have seen a lot is just like, again, this goes back to learning from Dropbox is the execution folks taking a class or reading a lot about growth and trying to do the same thing and not really actually starting from first let's look at our data. Let's talk to our customers. What do we think are the biggest hypotheses? And starting your experiments based on your own data and right-sizing the experiment.
:
I think sometimes teams are experimenting on things that are too small, that aren't going to move the needle because they heard it was really successful company X, but that company X might be a Dropbox where every 0.5% improvement in conversion makes a difference, but if you're early stage doesn't matter and you need to actually think bigger. The other thing is the opposite problem, redoing a whole thing but not having a hypothesis, this was an early mistake I made at Dropbox where I redid the checkout page to something that I thought was better UX, but then I changed so many different components that even when it failed, it was unclear why it failed. So really distilling it to hypotheses.
:
And then the last thing I would say is figuring out what I call the flying formation of how the different growth teams will work with other companies. And again, I alluded to this, but growth shouldn't feel like it's a layer on top. And a lot of the things that are tricky early on is figuring out how you work with other teams. I think the best or the ideal way to work is to have growth infuse in the company. And so an example here is often the growth team is going to be potentially the closest to the user.
:
They're going to get a lot of feedback. They're going to hear directly from the user. As a growth team, I think one of the big values that we can have is actually giving that feedback back to other teams at the company. And so even as a growth team, can we help inform the product roadmap? Also on the reverse, thinking about as PMs, how can PMs be more growth oriented as well?
Lenny :
I like this term flying formation. I've never heard of this before. What is that exactly again? Is that just how growth is integrated within the company?
Melissa Tan :
Yeah, I guess flying formation essentially, I don't know where it comes from. I guess maybe it's a military term or something. Your finger.
Lenny :
I can say that. Yeah, like the Blue Angels
Melissa Tan :
Work together?
Lenny :
Yeah.
Melissa Tan :
Yeah. I think of flying formation as how do we work together across teams. You also can think of it as a DACI too, driver accountable, contribute informed. I think sometimes when you don't know how you're going to work together, you end up stepping over each other's toes. You're unclear. Who was the decision maker here? Who did we need to work with? At what point in the journey? And so the flying formation, what I think it is, is part of it is a DACI of what are the different roles?
Lenny :
Can you define that actually? Because a lot of people probably won't know that term.
Melissa Tan :
A DACI is a framework to think about the different roles on the team on a project or an area. So D stands for Driver. This is the person driving the project. A is Accountable, this is the person that's ultimately accountable and is often the final decision maker if there's any open questions. C is Contributor, these are all the different teams that are going to contribute. And then I is informed. These are the people that need to be informed, but they're not directly contributing. They're not a decision maker and part of the project.
:
And so it's a nice simple framework for when you are working across teams and it needs to be clear who is in what role. And the area that tends to be the most confusing can be the accountable and who the decision maker is. It can be easy to have lots of teams and then it's unclear how do we get to a decision ultimately and who should make that decision. And that person should often be the person that has the most context or is ultimately responsible.
:
And so I think the flying formation has this DACI. I often also put operating rhythms in it, so it's clear what is happening at what point. And so we created a flying formation when we were first starting the growth team at Webflow and we were trying to figure out how does product growth work with product, how does product growth work with growth marketing? What are the different cadences that each team has? And so very tactically we put a doc together to say, okay, product growth is accountable for all the metrics downstream of signups. Growth marketing is accountable for signups. They're also driving or have goals around CAC, their customer acquisition costs, and these are the different metrics everyone owns.
:
We have a weekly meeting where we look at the metrics together. We also will do updates around the room to talk about initiatives and identify areas we want to work with. And then we also think through quarterly planning where we're each identifying projects that we're driving. There's some projects that we might also work on together. And so it's essentially that meeting cadence that you're going to have the operating rhythms. That's essentially how I think about a flying formation.
Lenny :
I love it. That would make a great blog post. By the way, if you're looking for something to write an example of your actual client formation Webflow, I think people would love that.
Melissa Tan :
Yeah.
Lenny :
One kind of tangent that I wanted to touch on is there's this trend of product teams owning revenue. Elena talked about this on a recent podcast. You have a perspective on should product growth teams own revenue and have revenue numbers as their goals or not?
Melissa Tan :
Yeah, really it depends on the company and what product growth is driving. I've always, in the companies I was at and actually even the companies I advise, the product growth team owns revenue, so it's not always the case. I've actually seen revenue owned by marketing. So marketing makes sense if it's more top of funnel growth. I've also seen it, this is an interesting one, by finance actually. This is usually early in the company.
:
So early at Canva, it was owned by finance and that's because finance had a view on everything happening in the business and would actually be maybe advising other teams on, "Hey, our conversion rates could improve, we need to do X." Or we're not driving signups and customers efficiently, but over time it doesn't really sit in finance. That has evolved and then now sits under the person that is driving product growth in product. So I have seen it more often than not being owned by product. Our team at Dropbox moved a ton actually. We started marketing. We actually then report into the revenue org with sales, and then we finally moved into product because we realized so much of our revenue was that product growth motion happening in the product that we felt it was important that that product team owned revenue.
Lenny :
A lot of the things you're talking about are based in how growth starts at a company. I imagine one of the most common questions you get is, how do I start to invest in growth? How do I hire my first growth person? How do I build a team around them? It's one of the most common questions I get. So let's spend a little time here. What is your advice to founders that are just starting to think about building their initial growth team and how to approach that to look for initially and kind of think about that longer term?
Melissa Tan :
I get this question a lot as well. I'd say initially when a company's starting out, the goal is getting to product market fit and figuring out who their ideal customer profile is, like their ICP. And at this point, I think everyone at the company should be thinking about growth. They're finding their first few design partners that they will co-create the product with. They're figuring out who is their product resonating with, who is maybe also the decision maker in purchasing the product. And they're figuring out, do we want kind of a bottom up product led motion? Are we going to lean more heavily into sales? Are we going to do both?
:
After you reach product market fit and you're starting to get your first few customers, the first growth per person I see more often than not isn't someone driving acquisition. You need to find your first a thousand or thousands of customers and you need to do it at scale. And so if that is the focus of the company, typically what I would recommend is somebody that they don't need to be an expert, but ideally they understand maybe one or two channels well and that they're the channels that you have hypothesis, you will find traction in.
:
And I see this person a little bit like a portfolio manager, right? Because you're trying to figure out ... Usually companies don't have many channels that are split evenly. They find one or two that really work and make up like it's 80/20 rule. It makes us up 80% of where the signups are coming from and this portfolio manager is testing different things out. Even you could leverage agencies. There are a lot of agencies out there for SEO, for paid marketing, et cetera, but they are smart enough to define, is this working? How do I do it at scale? You also want to make sure it's quality signups that are actually monetizable.
:
And so that is a role typically if you're hiring an acquisition of that first growth person. And then the other two areas to focus early on, but I don't think you need a dedicated person for are activation. You want to make sure as you're pouring leads into the top of funnel, you're activating users. And here I don't think you actually need to do AB testing. Your volume isn't probably going to be strong enough. I think even just finding five individuals that are part of your target audience, just doing user testing, set up a Zoom, watch them onboard onto the product and have them talk out loud. You'll fight a lot and you can also just take best practices of onboarding checklists, et cetera. So activation and then I've said this a lot, but pricing and packaging, really thinking about pricing, but I don't think that needs to be a dedicated person.
Lenny :
What kind of profile have you found to be most successful for this sort of person? Some people will look for like, I want to hire Melissa and let's just go big. The best person I can find and have them own this versus someone that's just new from school that's going to figure it out and I guess they're somewhere in the middle. What do you find that's best for that first hire?
Melissa Tan :
It really depends on the current makeup of the team. How much do the founders themselves or the current team, how much of an interest do they have in growth? If they have an interest in growth and it's more about finding someone to execute, I think it's finding someone that's a bit earlier in their career potentially that is just a strong first principles thinker. I think there's hit or miss on, I'm a former consultant, so I used to always say find a former consultant. I do think there can be hit or miss and there is some value in folks that actually understand acquisition and have done it before and so maybe have figured out certain channels.
:
So I think you either go for someone that's done acquisition before, maybe they're a little bit early in their career, so they have this great growth mindset, but make sure they're a first principles thinker. The other option is find just a really smart person early in their career, have them take up Reforge class, have them soak up everything, and then the other option of hiring someone more experienced. I think it really depends on if you want that person to take on a lot more and be almost part of your founding team. And do you want to find someone that is going to join your leadership team?
:
The other option I guess is you could also just bring on an advisor and that advisor is someone that's not full time. It can even guide if you hire someone that's a bit earlier, guide that person and that is a really good combination. And so it really depends on the context, who's also on the current team and who you want to bring into. Are you looking for an actual leader that's going to scale with the company or are you not ready quite yet for that?
Lenny :
What about in terms of their skillset? I imagine if you're kind of feeling like paid growth is going to be your main acquisition channel, you probably want to find someone that's really good at that versus it might be a virality, product led growth stuff, then you want to find maybe a product range of person. How much weight do you put into that skillset in that first hire?
Melissa Tan :
I actually think it's less about expertise in skillset, if that makes sense. And more there a ability to, again, I think of it like a portfolio manager. So this is more on the growth marketing side and bringing in acquisition. They are managing a portfolio and they're trying to figure out what works. I actually think you need to find someone that's analytical for this role, but that also understands things like who is the user? They're really creative in finding the user. And so it's actually looking for attributes but not expertise.
:
I actually think the more expertise someone has, the more it actually can lead to a false precision and then thinking they know what they're going to do. And especially, I don't think you actually need paid marketing expertise until much later when you're starting to think about incrementality or you're managing all these campaigns. I actually think the expertise is more important later. And then similarly on product growth, I actually think product growth is not higher till much later. A lot of early stage companies don't even have a product manager until later. And so I find that a growth product person isn't until much later down the road.
Lenny :
Just a couple more questions. One is, you mentioned that it sometimes makes sense to bring on an advisor. I know sometimes companies have a bad time with advisors that just don't provide much value and they're giving equity. Other times it's transformative. Some of the stories you've shared, when is it appropriate to hire an advisor and is there any, I guess advice for what to look for in a growth advisor at this early stage, especially?
Melissa Tan :
I would add an advisor if there is probably a knowledge gap on the team is I would say. And their advisors come in so many different forms too, and everyone does it slightly differently. For some folks, it's a monthly call for other times, especially when I'm full-time advising, I'll have weekly calls. I'll even join some team meetings. I'll look at mocks. And so everyone does it slightly differently. And so I think it depends on what you're looking for. I would definitely say that even getting to know the individual and making sure you're on the same page on what you're looking for and what the goals are. And then what I've done in the past too is initially set up a shorter engagement, like a quarter long engagement and then decide if you want to go longer.
:
And I also think it's fine to, let's say you have an advisor agreement, you're not getting value to basically part ways. If it's not, you're not finding value. I think every advisor wants to make sure they're adding value. So I definitely think to summarize, being really explicit on what advice you're looking for and making sure you're on the same page of what you want. And then also set up a try before you buy if you want to do a quarter long engagement first. And knowing you can always part ways if it's not a fit even before that period of time.
Lenny :
Last question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. You've brought up this concept of first principles thinking. I'm curious how you measure that and how you get a sense of, is this person strong at first principles thinking?
Melissa Tan :
It's definitely a word I use a lot. First principles thinking, I think of it as you are not using a set framework and set formula, but you're creating your own based on the context that you're getting. And so when I think about first principles thinking often it is knowing what questions to ask so that you can start forming a mental model. And then it is actually starting to form that mental model and then knowing to evolve it and knowing when it's not working and really coming from a place of curiosity of is this really working? This is something that I'm known for on my team as well, which is I ask tons of questions, but it doesn't come from a place of wanting to show that I'm asking good questions or anything that comes from a place of trying to solve the problem and making sure that we're always solving the problem at hand, making sure we're doing the right things.
:
If there's new information, do we actually still want to do it this way? And so I think first principles thinking is often about asking questions and then creating your own framework. That's how I would define it. And it's maybe another way to describe it is critical thinking. It's like you're able to think very critically, and I think it's important to, at least for me, create a culture where that's okay. I think the moment you have a culture where people aren't asking questions aren't constantly revisiting their work, that's when you're not maybe pushing yourself to do your best work. And I think it also just creates a fun environment where we're like, "Oh yeah, why are we doing this?" And really leading with your curiosity.
Lenny :
Is there an example of a person or moment or question that comes to mind of this is an epitome of a first principles thinker moment or question or a way of approaching something?
Melissa Tan :
My aha moment of the value of first principles thinking was when I was at Dropbox and we had the most unconventional people on our initial sales team. Dropbox was known for this. We would hire a ton of really smart people that had never done sales and had them do sales. There were a lot of disadvantages to that, I think. We were figuring a lot of things out. Maybe we should have split, had a few people that knew sales better and a combo of both. But I do think it led to a ton of innovation. Even I actually started on the sales team, this is a fun fact. I used to answer the 1-800 number at Dropbox, and if you go to Dropbox's website, you see a chat level. I used to also do that role, and so I think that what we got from that was that's how we got our very innovative go-to-market motions.
:
That also gave a ton of people, 'cause a lot of those people then moved into different functions at the company. They had all this context on who the user was. They had talked to so many different users at that point, and that's actually what helped me a lot when I moved into growth is I had all that context and I learned from that going back to first principles thinking that if you take people that are just super smart, they've never done it before, one advantage of that is they can innovate because I think they come in with, "I don't know anything. Let me just figure this out." Versus someone that think they know all the answers, limits you into what you are going to do. And so my aha moment was really at Dropbox seeing so many times people that had never done these things and then seeing so much innovation come as a result of that.
Lenny :
That is an awesome story. Is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on before we get to or very exciting lightning round?
Melissa Tan :

**I think that's it. I wanted to make sure, I know I talked a lot about developing people, so thank all the people that have helped develop me in my career and then especially thank all the folks that I've worked with and my team, especially the team at Webflow and particularly wanted to make sure to thank [Xing Lin 01**:

10:14], Rory Davidson and [Jo Wang01:10:16] who joined me from previous companies to Webflow.
Lenny :
Shoutouts. Well, with that, Melissa, we have reached our very exciting lightning ground. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
Melissa Tan :
Yes.
Lenny :
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Melissa Tan :
The first one is Leaders Eat Last. I really like that leadership book by Simon Sinek. Also two non-career related books is The Untethered Soul. It really has taught me a lot about being present and then also the Four Agreements, which is a very short and easy read, but good principles to live by.
Lenny :
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?
Melissa Tan :
This one isn't super recent, but Winning Time on HBO. It's about the LA Lakers during the '80s and the Showtime era. I'm originally from LA and grew up a Lakers fan, so it's a fun watch for me and a nice escape.
Lenny :
You'll love a new movie I just watched last night called Air, which is about how Nike got Michael Jordan signed. And it's similar vibes to that show.
Melissa Tan :
Yes, yes. I actually just watched that recently too.
Lenny :
Okay. Great.
Melissa Tan :
That's a good one too. Yeah, I've watched all those basketball.
Lenny :
Oh man. I also grew up in LA. Also a huge Laker fan from-
Melissa Tan :
Oh, nice.
Lenny :
From before. Next question, what's a favorite interview question you like to ask?
Melissa Tan :
For me, it's not a question, but it's that stage of preparing before the presentation and getting a sense for what it's like to work with each other. I think that has been one of the best ways for me to get signal.
Lenny :
Can you say more on that?
Melissa Tan :
Yes. So it's essentially that prep call before I ask them to do a presentation and going through the presentation together and working together on refining it.
Lenny :
Awesome. We already talked about that, so we'll move on. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?
Melissa Tan :
I feel like everyone's saying this, but ChatGPT. I feel like it has really changed everything. There's so many interesting ways to use it. My team at Webflow right now is also starting to think about incorporating AI into the product, and so yeah, I just think that is ... Yeah, so many things you can do with it.
Lenny :
What is something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on the way that your team executes?
Melissa Tan :
This one here is what I also spoke about for earlier, which is, I mean, thinking through your DACI. It sounds so simple, but I do think a lot of times teams are thinking through how do they work with other teams? Who is driving? Who is the decision maker? And so having a DACI, I have found is really helpful.
Lenny :
Final question, you've been at Webflow for a number of years. What is a favorite pro tip for using Webflow?
Melissa Tan :
Yeah, I actually have two if that's okay.
Lenny :

**That's good. Even better [inaudible 01**:

13:01].
Melissa Tan :
Yeah, yeah. So one is thing that I've often heard from folks is it's hard to learn Webflow. And so basically watching our university videos, which is where we teach Webflow while also building the designer, and we actually now enable to have the videos in the product, so you can do them side by side. And then the other one is our Figma to Webflow plugin, which is you can take a Figma design and then convert it to Webflow, which is a great hack if you already have a design in Figma.
Lenny :
Wow, I did not know that existed. That is a really smart idea and feature. Melissa, I could see why people follow you from company to company. I feel like the companies that are going to get to work with you in this new stage of your life are also very lucky. Thank you for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Melissa Tan :
Folks can find me on LinkedIn, also on Twitter, Melissamtan, and then how can listeners be helpful to me? I mean, I love jamming on things, growth, thinking about leadership and managing, so if any of this resonates, reach out. I'd love to have a discussion and yeah.
Lenny :
Amazing. Melissa, again, thank you for being here.
Melissa Tan :
Yes, thanks so much, Lenny. This was fun.
