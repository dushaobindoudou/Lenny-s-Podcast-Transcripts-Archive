**Okay, so speaking of humans, I want to chat about the future a little bit. So you have three kids, and a community member asked me this hilarious question that I think it's something a lot of people are thinking about. So this is Patrick [inaudible 01**:

04:47]. I worked with him at Airbnb. He says ask what he's encouraging his kids to learn to prepare for the future. I'm worried my 6-year-old by the year 2036 will face a lot of competition trying to get into the top roofing or plumbing programs and need a backup plan.
Kevin Weil :
That's funny. So our kids, we have a 10 year old and eight year old twins, so they're still pretty young. It's amazing how AI native they are. It's completely normal to them that there are self-driving cars. That they can talk to AI all day long. They have full conversations with Chat GPT and Alexa and everything else. I don't know, who knows what the future holds? I think things like coding skills are going to be relevant for a long time, who knows? But I think if you teach your kids to be curious, to be independent, to be self-confident, you teach them how to think, I don't know what the future holds, but I think that those are going to be skills that are going to be important in any configuration of the future. And so it's not like we have all the answers, but that's how Elizabeth and I think about our kids.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And do you find that AI... There's a lot of talk about AI tutoring. Is that something you guys are doing? I know they're using Chat GPT, I love all the photos you post where they're playing with prompts and stuff, but I guess is there anything there you're experimenting with or you think is going to become really important?
Kevin Weil :
This is something that... It's maybe the most important thing that AI could do. Maybe that's a grand statement. There are lots of important things that AI can do, including speeding up the pace of fundamental science research and discovery, which maybe is actually the most important thing AI can do. But one of the most important things would be personalized tutoring. And it kind of blows my mind that there is still... I know there are a bunch of good products out there. Khan Academy does great things. They're a wonderful partner of ours. Vinod Khosla has a non-profit that's doing some really interesting stuff in this space and is making an impact. But I'm kind of surprised that there isn't a 2 billion kid AI personalized tutoring thing because the models are good enough to do it now, and every study out there that's ever been done seems to show that when you have... Like, education is still important, but when you combine that with personalized tutoring, you get multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed.
:
And so it's uncontroversial, it's good for kids, it's free. Chat GPT is free, you don't need to pay, and the models are good enough. It still just kind of blows my mind that there isn't something amazing out there that our kids are using and your future kids are using, and people in all sorts of places around the world that aren't as lucky as our kids to be able to have this sort of built-in, solid education. Again, Chat GPT is free. People have Android devices everywhere. I really just think this could change the world and I'm surprised it doesn't exist and I want it to exist.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This kind of touches on something I want to spend a little time on, which is a lot of people also worry a lot about AI, where it's going, they worry about jobs it's going to take, they worry about the super intelligence squashing humanity in the future. What's your perspective on that and just the optimistic case that I think people need to hear?
Kevin Weil :
I mean, I'm a big technology optimist. I think if you look over the last 200 years, maybe more, technology has driven a lot of the advancements that have made us the world and the society that we are today. It drives economic advancements, it drives geopolitical advancements, quality of life, longevity advancement. I mean, technology's at the root of just about everything, so I think there are very few examples where this is anything but a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't...
Kevin Weil :
... a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't temporary dislocations or where there aren't individuals that are impacted, and that matters too. So it can't just be that the average is good. You've got to also think about how you take care of each individual person as best you can.
:
It is something that we think a lot about and as we work with the administration, as we work with policy, we try and help wherever we can. We do a lot with education. One of the benefits here is that ChatGPT is also perhaps the best reskilling app you could possibly want. It knows a lot of things. It can teach you a lot of things if you're interested in learning new things.
:
These are very real issues. I'm super optimistic about the long run, and we're going to need to do everything we can as a society to ensure that we make this transition as graceful and as well-supported as we can.
Lenny Rachitsky :
To give people a sense of where things might be going. That's a big question in a lot of people's minds. So someone asked this question that I love, which is, "AI is already changing, creative work in a lot of different ways, writing and design and coding, what do you think is the next big leap? What should we be thinking is the next big leap in AI-assisted creativity specifically, and then just broadly, where do you think things are going to be going in the next few years?"
Kevin Weil :
Yeah. This is also an area where I'm a big optimist. If you look at Sora, for example. I mean we talked about ImageGen earlier and the absolute fount of creativity that people are putting across Twitter and Instagram and other places. I am the world's worst artist like the worst. Maybe the only thing I'm worse at than art is singing. Give me a pencil and a pad of paper and I can't draw better than our eight-year-old. But give me ImageGen and I can think some creative thoughts and put something into the model and suddenly have output that I couldn't have possibly done myself. That's pretty cool.
:
Even you look at folks that are really talented. I was talking to a director recently about Sora, someone who's directed films that we would all know, and he was saying, for a film that he's doing, take the example of some sort of sci-fi-ish, think of Star Wars, and you've got some scene where there's a plane zooming into some Death Star-like thing. And so you've got the plane looking at the whole planet, and then you want to cut to a scene where the plane's kind of at the ground level, and all of a sudden you see the city and everything else. How are we going to manage that cut scene? And that transition?
:
And he was saying, "In the world of two years ago, I would have paid a 3D effects company a hundred grand and they would've taken a month, and they would've produced two versions of this cut scene for me. And I would've evaluated them. We would've chosen one, because what are you going to do? Pay another 50 grand and wait another month. And we would've just gone with it. And it would be fine. Movies are great. I love them. And there've been..."
:
Obviously, we can do great things with the technology that we've had, but you now look at what you can do with Sora. And his point was, "Now, I can use Sora, our video model, and I can get 50 different variations of this cut scene just me brainstorming into a prompt and the model brainstorming a little bit with me. I've got 50 different versions. And then of course, I can iterate off of those and refine them and take different ideas. And now I'm still going to go to that 3D effects studio to produce the final one, but I'm going to go having brainstormed and had a much more creative approach with an outcome that's much better. And I did that assisted by AI."
:
My personal view on creativity in general is that it's no one's going to... You don't type into Sora like, "Make me a great movie." It requires creativity and ingenuity, and all these things, but it can help you explore more. It can help you get to a better final result. So, again, I tend to be an optimist in most things, but actually, I think there's a very good story here.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I know Sam Altman, I think it was him who tweeted recently, the creative writing piece that you guys are working on where it's... He is very bad at writing creative stuff, and he shared an example where it's actually really good. I imagine that's another area of investment.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah, there's some exciting stuff happening internally with some new research techniques. We'll have more to say about that at some point. But yeah, Sam sometimes likes to show off some of the stuff that's coming, which is smart. By the way, it's very indicative of this iterative deployment philosophy. We don't have some breakthrough and keep it to ourselves forever, and then bestow it upon the world someday. We kind of just talk about the things we're working on and share when we can and launch early and often, and then iterate in public. I really like that philosophy.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love all these hints that a few things coming. I know you can't say too much. You talked about how there might be a coding leap coming in the near future maybe by the time this comes out. Is there anything else people should be thinking about, might be coming in the near future? Any things you can tease that are interesting? Exciting?
Kevin Weil :
Man, this hasn't been enough for you?
Lenny Rachitsky :
Only everything is getting better every day.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah. I'm like, man, I hope we get some of this stuff out before the episode launches so-
Lenny Rachitsky :
This is your new timebox.
Kevin Weil :
... I don't piss people off. The amazing thing to me is we were talking earlier about how far models have come in just a couple of years. If you went back to GPT-3, you'd be disgusted by how bad it was, even though Lenny of two years ago was mind-blown by how good these were. And for a long time, we were iterating every six to nine months on a new GPT model. It was like GPT-3, GPT-3.5, 4, and now with this o-series of reasoning models, we're moving even faster. Every roughly three months, maybe four months, there's a new o-series model, and each of them is a step up in capability.
:
And so the capabilities of these models are increasing at a massive pace. They're also getting cheaper as they scale. You look at where we were even a couple of years ago. I think the original, I don't know, what was it, GPT-3.5 or something was like 100 x the cost of GPT-4o mini today in the API. A couple of years, you've gone down two orders of magnitude in cost for much more intelligence. And so I don't know where there's another series of trends like that in the world. Models are getting smarter, they're getting faster, they're getting cheaper, and they're getting safer too. They hallucinate less every iteration.
:
And so the Morse Law and transistors becoming ubiquitous. That was a law around doubling the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months. If you're talking about something where you're getting 10 x every year, that's a massively steeper exponential. And it tells us that the future is going to be very different than today. The thing I try and remind myself is, the AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life. And when you actually get that in your head, it's kind of wild.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I was going to actually say the same thing, and that's the thing that always sticks with me when I watch this thing. You're talking about Sora, and I imagine many people hearing that are like, "No, no. It's not actually ready. It's not good enough. It's not going to be as good as a movie I see in the theater." But the point is what you just made that this is the worst it's going to be. It will only get better.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah, model maximalism. Just keep building for the capabilities that are almost there, and the model's going to catch up and be amazing.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Escape to where the puck is going to be.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
This reminds me, I was just using... I was duplifying everything the other day and I was just like, "What is taking so long."
Kevin Weil :
As one does.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just like cut... What was that?
Kevin Weil :
I said, as one does.
Lenny Rachitsky :
As one does these days. I was just like, "It's taking a minute to generate this image of my family in this amazing way." Come on, what's taking so long. You just get so used to magic happening in front of you.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah, totally.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Okay, final question. This is going to go in a completely different direction. A lot of people asked about this. So famously, you led this project at Facebook called Libra, which is now called Novi. A lot of people always wondered, "What happened there? That was a really cool idea." I know some people have a sense there's regulation challenges, things like that. I don't know if you've talked about this much. So I guess, could you just give people a brief summary of just what is Libra? This project you working on, and just what happened, and how you feel about it?
Kevin Weil :
Yeah. I mean, David Marcus led it, and I happily work for him and with him. I think he's a visionary and also a mentor and a friend. Honestly, Libra is probably the biggest disappointment of my career. When I think about the problems we were solving, which are very real problems. If you look at, for example, the remittance space, people sending money to family members in other countries, it is maybe... I mean it's incredibly regressive, right? People that don't have the money to spend are having to pay 20% to send money home to their family. So outrageous fees, it takes multiple days, you have to go then pick up cash from... It's all bad.
:
And here we are with 3 billion people using WhatsApp all over the world, talking to each other every day, especially friends and family, and exactly the kind of people who'd send money to each other. Why can't you send money as immediately, as cheaply, as simply as you send a text message? It is one of those things when you sit back and think about it, that should just exist. And that was what we set out to try and do.
:
Now, I don't think we played all of our cards perfectly. If I could go back and do things, there are a bunch of things I would do differently.
:
We tried to get it all at once. We tried to launch a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger, and I think the whole world kind of went like, "Oh my God, that's a lot of change at once." And it happened also to be at the time that Facebook was at the absolute nadir of its reputation. And so that didn't help. It was also not the Messenger that people wanted for this kind of change. We knew all that going in, but we went for it.
:
I think there are a bunch of ways that we could do that that would've introduced the change a little bit more gently, maybe still gotten to that same outcome, but fewer new things at once and introduced the new things one at a time. Who knows? Those were decisions we made together. So we all own them. Certainly, I own them. But it fundamentally disappoints me that this doesn't exist in the world today because the world would be a better place if we'd been able to ship that product. I would be able to send you 50 cents in WhatsApp for free. It would settle instantly. Everybody would have a balance in their WhatsApp account. We'd be transact... I mean, it should exist.
:
I don't know. To be honest, the current administration is super friendly to crypto. Facebook's reputation, Meta's reputation is in a very different place. Maybe they should go build it now.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I was looking at the history of it, and apparently, they sold the tech to some private equity company for 200 million bucks.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah, yeah, and-
Lenny Rachitsky :
They had to buy it back.
Kevin Weil :
There are a couple of current blockchains that are built on the tech because the tech was open-sourced from the beginning. Aptos and Mistin are two companies that are built off of this tech. So at least all of the work that we did, did not die and lives on in these two companies, and they're both doing really well. But still, we should be able to send each other money in WhatsApp, and we can't today.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Hear, hear. Well, thanks for sharing that story, Kevin. Is there anything else you want to share or maybe a last negative advice or insight before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Kevin Weil :
Ooh, the lightning round. Let's just go do that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's do it. With that, Kevin, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Kevin Weil :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Let's do it. Okay. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
Kevin Weil :
Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick, a really good book about AI and how to use it in your daily life as a student, as a teacher. He's super thoughtful. Also, by the way, a very good follow on Twitter. The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zion. Very good if you're interested in geopolitics and the forces that sort of shape the dynamics happening. And then I really enjoyed Cable Cowboy, I don't know who the author is, but the biography of John Malone. Just fascinating. If you like business, especially if you want to get into... I mean the man was an incredible dealmaker and shaped a lot of the modern cable industry. So that was a good biography.
Lenny Rachitsky :
These are all first-time mentions, which is always a great,
Kevin Weil :
Oh, good.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?
Kevin Weil :
I wish I had time to watch a TV show, so I'm-
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just Sora videos.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah, right. I don't know. When I was a kid, I read the Wheel of Time series and now Amazon has it as they're in the third season of it, so I want to watch that. I haven't yet. Top Gun 2 was an awesome movie. I think that's no longer new.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That shows when the last time you watched a movie was.
Kevin Weil :
But I like the idea. I want more Americana. I want more being proud of being strong. And I thought Top Gun 2 did a really good job of that. Pride and patriotism, I think the US could use more of that.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Is there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love, other than your super intelligence internal tool that you all have access to? I'm just joking.
Kevin Weil :
That's right. Internal AGR.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Yeah, that's right.
Kevin Weil :
Well, I think vibe coding with products like Windsurf is just super fun. I'm having a great time doing that. I still just love that our chief people officer vibe coded some tools. Maybe the other one is Waymo. Every chance I get, I'll take a Waymo. It's just a better way of riding, and it still feels like the future. So they've done an amazing job.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's awesome. By the way, I had the founder of Windsurf on the podcast. It might come out before this or after this. And also Cursor's CEO is coming on the podcast either before or after this.
Kevin Weil :
Oh, cool. I have a ton of respect for what those guys are doing. Those are awesome products.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Just changing the way everyone builds product. No big deal.
Kevin Weil :
Yeah.
Lenny Rachitsky :
A couple more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, find really useful in work or in life?
Kevin Weil :
Yeah. So actually, this is interestingly enough, it is more of a philosophy, but then I thought Zuck encapsulated it one time on a Facebook earnings call. So I actually had this made into a poster. It sits in my room. But somebody was asking Mark. This is literally on an earnings call, so it's like an analyst on an earnings call asking him. It was some quarter when Facebook had grown a lot. This was back in the 20 teens sometime, I think. But he's like, "So what did you do? What was it that you launched? What was the one thing that drove all this growth for you?" And he said something to the effect of, "Sometimes it's not any one thing, it's just good work consistently over a long period of time." And that's always stuck with me.
:
And I think it is. I mean I run ultra marathons. It's like it's just about grinding. I think people too often look for the silver bullet when a lot of life and a lot of excellence is actually showing up day in and day out, doing good work, getting a little bit better every single day, and you may not notice it over a week or even a month. And a lot of people then kind of get dismayed and stop. But actually, you keep doing it. The gains keep compounding. And over the course of a year, two years, five years, it adds up like crazy. So good work consistently over a long period of time.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I love that. I got to make a poster of this now. That is-
Kevin Weil :
We'll get you one.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I so resonate with that. Okay, I'll take it. That is so good. Okay, final question. I'm going to ask if you have any prompting tricks, and I'm going to set it up first. But think about if you have a trick that you could recommend to people for prompting LLMs better. I had a guest, Alex Komorowski, come on the podcast. He's from Stripe and writes his weekly reflections on what's happening in the world. A lot of them are AI-related.
:
And he once described an LLM as a zip file of all human knowledge. All the answers are in there, and you just need to figure out the right question to ask to get the answer to every problem basically. And so it just reminded me how important prompt engineering is and knowing how to prompt well. You're constantly prompting ChatGPT. What's one tip, one trick that you found to be helpful in helping you get what you want?
Kevin Weil :
Well, I'll say, first of all, I want to kill the idea that you have to be a good prompt engineer. I think if we do our jobs, that stops being true. It's just one of those sharp edges of models that experts can learn. But then, just over time, you shouldn't need to know all that. The same way you used to have to get deep into, "What's your storage engine in MySQL? Are you using InnoDB 4.1?" There's still use cases for that if you're at the deep edge of MySQL performance. But most people don't need to care. And you shouldn't need to care about minute details of prompting if AI is really going to become broadly adopted.
:
But today, we're not totally there. I think by the way, we are making progress there. I think there is less prompt engineering than there had to be before. But in line with some of the fine-tuning stuff I was talking about and the importance of giving examples, you can do effectively poor man's fine-tuning by including examples in your prompt of the kinds of things that you might want and a good answer. So like, "Here's an example and here's a good answer. Here's an example, and here's a good answer. Now, go solve this problem for me." And the model really will listen and learn from that.
:
Not as well as if you do a full fine-tune, but much more than if you don't provide any examples. And I think people don't do that often enough.
Lenny Rachitsky :
That's awesome. One tip that I heard, I'm curious if this works is you tell it, "This is very, very important to my career." Make it really understand like, "Someone will die if you don't answer me correctly." Does that work?
Kevin Weil :
It's really weird. There's probably a good explanation for this. But you can also say things. So, yes, I think there is some validity to that. You can also say things like, "I want you to be Einstein. Now, answer this physics problem for me," or, "You are the world's greatest marketer, the world's greatest brand marketer. Now here's a naming question." And there is something where it sort of shifts the model into a certain mindset that can actually be really positive.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I use that tip all the time actually. I always... When I'm coming up with questions for interviews and I use it occasionally to come up with things I haven't thought of, I actually type, "You're the world's best podcast interviewer."
Kevin Weil :
Right.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I have Kevin Weil coming on the pod... Yeah, it actually works.
Kevin Weil :
By the way, back to our other point that we made a few times. You do do that sometimes with people. You sort of put them... You frame things, you get them into a certain mindset, and the answer is completely different. So I think there are human analogs of this one more time.
Lenny Rachitsky :
Kevin, this was incredible. I was just thinking about a way to end this. The way I feel like... I feel like not only are you at the cutting edge of the future. You and the team are kind of actually the edge that is creating the future. And so it's a real honor to have you on here and to talk to you and to hear where you think things are going and what we need to be thinking about, so thank you for being here, Kevin.
Kevin Weil :
Oh, thank you so much for having me. I get to work with the world's best team, and all credit to them, but really appreciate you having me on. It's been super fun.
Lenny Rachitsky :
I forgot to ask you the two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Kevin Weil :
I am @kevinweil, K-E-V-I-N-W-E-I-L on pretty much every platform. I'm still a Twitter DAU after all these years. I guess an X DAU, LinkedIn, wherever. And I think the thing I would love from people, give me feedback. People are using ChatGPT. Tell me where it's working really well for you and where you want us to double down. Tell me where it's failing. I'm very active and engaged on Twitter. I love hearing from people, what's working and what's not, so don't be shy.
Lenny Rachitsky :
And I learned following you helps you figure out all the stuff that you're launching. You share all the things that are going out every day, or week, month, so that's also a benefit. And by the way, 400 million weekly active users all emailing you feedback. Here we go.
Kevin Weil :
Yes, let's do it.
Lenny Rachitsky :
It's going to work out great. Okay. Well, thank you, Kevin. Thanks for being here.
Kevin Weil :
All right, man, thanks so much. See you soon.
Lenny Rachitsky :
